   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Over the last decade, the concept of ‚Äú‚Äù has gained huge popularity beyond meditation, spiritual, and yoga circles. Despite being an ancient technique (mindfulness meditation originated 2,500 years ago as taught by Buddha), understanding of the  began to develop more recently. The Oxford Dictionary  to mindfulness as ‚Äúa mental state achieved by focusing one‚Äôs awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one‚Äôs feelings, thoughts, and bodily sensations, used as a therapeutic technique. ‚Äù By being aware of our behaviors, thoughts, and sensations, we are more in control of how we perceive and interpret the elements of our environment, leading us to make conscious choices that align with our values. Furthermore, mindfulness also impacts our way of consuming. Thich Nhat Hanh states that, ‚ÄùMindful consumption is the way to heal ourselves and to heal the world.‚Äù What is mindful shopping? How do we make better purchasing decisions that have a positive impact on the world?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">An academic named  states that, ‚Äúpeople with higher materialistic values face a greater risk of unhappiness, including anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, and problems with intimacy‚Äú. Being mindful encourages us to appreciate the little things without wanting to possess more. In our world of rapid consumption, we tend to covet things, wanting to buy more and more as we enter a never ending cycle of behaviors that can lead to unhappiness. But what if we could make more conscious choices? What if we could remake the world with better decision-making processes that are aware of our impact on our surroundings? Let‚Äôs discuss how to start a mindful and ethical practice of consuming.</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-see-things-clearly-as-they-are""><strong>See Things Clearly as They Are</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindfulness often relies on the concept used in meditation to ‚Äúsee things as they are‚Äù. By being present and aware in the moment, we don‚Äôt overthink too much or lose control of what makes sense around us. Practicing mindful shopping involves conscious buying and taking into account that we don‚Äôt own everything on this earth. In a resource-limited world, it‚Äôs important to bear in mind that our consumerist behavior may impact our reality. For example, on the island of Bali, Balinese people did not use plastic. When colonizing the island, Europeans introduced plastic that never blended into the way of living for Balinese, resulting in huge pollution across the island.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We each have our own wants and needs that we attempt to satisfy in our pursuit of a fulfilling life. Being able to identify what we want versus what we actually need is a skill that takes practice. Maybe that means you ask yourself things like: do I need this new pair of shoes or do I want them? There are no wrong answers here, but taking an inventory of what we have in the here and now can be a helpful way to begin appreciating our current reality rather than seeking more just for the sake of having more. The latter can lead to unhealthy behavioral patterns where more is never enough, whereas centering ourselves with the ‚Äúless is more‚Äù philosophy and implementing mindful purchasing habits can have more positive results.</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-mindless-consumption-vs-mindful-consumption""><strong>Mindless Consumption vs. Mindful Consumption</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Today, we are asked more than ever to change our patterns and adopt mindful consumption instead of mindless consumption with the outbreak of COVID-19. Mindful consumption encourages us to take time and think twice before purchasing an item or a service in order to understand what impact our purchase may have on us, on society, and on our environment. For example, before buying another plastic bottle, we may think about how to repurpose our current plastic bottles. Maybe we can use them to store sand from our holiday, propagate plants, or simply reuse it for its intended purpose of carrying liquids. Our intentions and practices have an impact, so again, taking inventory and checking in with ourselves by identifying our needs and habits can have powerful implications.</p>

   <h1 id=""h-eastern-derived-approach""><strong>Eastern-Derived Approach</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In Buddhism, there is a focus on modest lifestyle, away from envy and cupidity. Generosity prevails, as well as being conscious that our time on earth is limited, the hope being to leave a positive trace of our presence here on earth. By understanding Buddhist philosophies, we can make reasonable purchases that are aligned with values of kindness, compassion, and love. We can always make better purchasing decisions which will be kind and compassionate.</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-a-daily-routine-to-adopt-mindful-shopping""><strong>A Daily Routine to Adopt Mindful Shopping</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindful shopping doesn‚Äôt have to be all or nothing, but can rather be practiced in different ways, both small and large scale, still having a powerful impact. Maybe that means before you take another trip to the grocery store, you double-check your fridge to see if you do in fact need more of something or if what you have will last. Or, maybe when you‚Äôre in search of new clothes, you take the time to research the brand in order to see if it‚Äôs ethically operated and sourced. Of course, we do not need to live like monks, although the life of monks is praised for being both fulfilling and happy. But we can embrace monk-based habits in our  by consuming only what we need. , we should refrain from impulsive purchasing behaviors that are not necessary and by doing so, we can live a happier, more fulfilling life.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We don‚Äôt need to take a 10-day spiritual retreat to learn more about mindfulness and adopt the practice on a daily basis. We can start by noting our thoughts and understanding how we breathe. Being present with ourselves, even just 10-minutes a day, can be a great start to mindfulness practices. Maybe that means reading books about meditation and mindfulness or journaling about our wants versus our needs. What works for you?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can think of a relationship as an entity unto itself, born out of the existence of those in the relationship. Merging with the background information and environmental context, the relationship grows into its own character and, to an extent, takes on determinative power based on the data with which it interacts.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A romantic relationship exists in its own individual space, which is in communication with other various resources in our lives. This space bears traces of what we transfer into it the most and that data can impact the health of the relationship just as it impacts each participant within it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each of us enters into our relationships with our own narratives, beliefs about life, about ourselves, our own fears, worries, hopes, pleasures, and more. Our relationship is largely nourished by the things that pertain to our individual stories. But those narratives can sometimes feel restrictive. Our insight into ourselves better enables us to become aware of what we bring into our relationship space. This awareness helps us not only to distinguish what‚Äôs holding us back in our own story, but also how we might reinforce those things that nourish us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-core-beliefs-relationships""><strong>Core Beliefs &amp; Relationships</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Examining our own beliefs as they exist in our relationship space is a good starting point. We all hold certain core beliefs about life and our role in it. Sometimes, we may feel overwhelmed with thoughts like: ‚ÄúI need to be perfect,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI need to overcome everything on my own,‚Äù or, maybe we feel more like we‚Äôre grounded in thoughts like: ‚ÄúI can fix this,‚Äù and, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not alone‚Äù. These feelings can be examples of how we navigate conflict, or, how we prepare ourselves for a challenge, yes, but they can also reveal clues for the deeper underlying context that gave rise to their existence in the first place and help to inform how we may behave in a relationship.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To look deeper into our relationships and how we may behave within them, we can start to ask ourselves questions like: How do I feel about my partner? How do I feel about relationships in general? Do my change when I‚Äôm feeling at ease or, conversely, when I‚Äôm feeling tense or stressed? If so, why? Do I use definitive language like ‚Äúalways‚Äù and ‚Äúnever‚Äù when I‚Äôm trying to explain my own experience of the relationship? If so, what am I usually talking about when I employ that language? Asking ourselves these questions can give insight into how we‚Äôre currently feeling in our romantic relationship. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-our-emotions-say""><strong>What Our Emotions Say</strong></h2>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our  is one of the spaces in which we may feel intense emotions. A lot of our positive or negative experiences with our partner echo in the depths of our inner world. Sometimes our emotions fester and become the dominant feeling associated with the relationship over time, blocking the flow of connection and joy. Therefore, it is essential that we try to understand which emotions increasingly take up a more room in our relationship space.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Developing an awareness around our own emotional needs can help us work toward a solution when challenging situations and feelings occur. We can begin to talk to our partner or partners about types of behavior that may trigger our anger, anxiety, fear, insecurity, or feeling like we‚Äôre being misunderstood when we communicate more openly about what we need.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We also want to be able to identify emotions and experiences that nourish our relationship. We can ask ourselves: under what circumstances do I feel most at ease, secure, understood, and happy? What kinds of activities allow those feelings to take hold and grow? Do I feel comfortable asking my partner or partners for support? Being curious about our partners‚Äô opinions while reflecting on the answers to these questions will allow for a holistic approach to this experience that includes your partner.&nbsp;</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our internal and external resources are support mechanisms that nourish our well-being. Just like us, our relationship has resources that fuel it as well. The activities we enjoy with our partner or partners, the things we share, the support we give each other, our intimacy, such resources feed the health of our relationship through different channels. Some of them might help us , maintain our feeling of happiness and joy, and some help us to fulfill our need for intimacy.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being able to activate the resources that feed our relationship is rooted in our ability to communicate with one another. Allowing each other time, expressing ourselves unreservedly, being willing to listen to our partner when we are stressed out, and developing an awareness of our own emotions and bodies are just some of the ways we can connect with each other and begin to use our available resources. Building our communication upon healthy coping mechanisms protects our relationship against vicious cycles of miscommunication.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôve discussed checking in with our own needs and the needs of our partner or partners to determine how we might support each other. These kinds of check-ins with each other can be applied to the relationship itself as well, especially over time. We should be asking ourselves and each other periodically: What has changed since the beginning of our relationship? What are the things that made us better or feel stronger together? What are we doing less of and what are we doing more of and how has that change in behavior impacted our relationship?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes life events like moving, changing jobs, giving birth, or losing a loved one can shift the dynamics of our relationships significantly. If that‚Äôs the case for you, how do you feel the impact of those major events on your relationships? Where do they take up space? Where do they influence how you respond to your partner or partners? Taking stock of the health of your relationship throughout time, particularly on the heels of a powerful transition in your life can help you communicate more clearly about what you need and bring you and your partner or partners closer together.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Identifying the structure or our relationship space and what it holds within it, helps us to come up with healthy solutions when things get challenging. Let‚Äôs visualize our relationship as a three-dimensional space, trying to picture what‚Äôs inside. Which of our beliefs are in there? How much space do they take up? How are your beliefs connected to your emotions? Maybe your love and desire are overshadowed by disappointment, making intimacy difficult. Maybe you‚Äôre not feeling understood and you begin to shut your partner or partners out. How long have you been feeling this way? What kind of changes would you like to see take place? What are the conditions under which you feel you would have more access to the things that nourish your relationship in a healthy way?The questions are limitless. There is so much information that this three-dimensional space can offer us. If we maintain our imaginative curiosity and desire for discovering ourselves and our partner or partners, we enrich our journey toward , connection, and joy.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As we all know, 2020 was a year of enormous change due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We all experienced this both individually and globally as the virus ravaged the world.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many of us had to adapt to a new reality overnight and one of the major changes this year brought was working from home or working remotely. This shift has meant that many had to learn to work differently in new and sometimes very stressful contexts.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Between daily chores, children, and limited space, working from home during the pandemic has been, and for some continues to be, a real challenge. So, it is in this very particular context that mindfulness has made its way into the lives of millions of people during the year of 2020.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The practice of Mindfulness, as we all know, allows us to better manage stress, adapt to change, and regain serenity in the middle of the storm. And that is exactly what we all needed in the face of this really destabilizing time.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúMindfulness is really important in times like this,‚Äù says Auguste H. Fortin VI, a general internist at Yale School of Medicine who has recommended mindfulness practices to some of his patients to help them cope with their illnesses. With COVID-19 front and center in nearly every aspect of our lives he believes that, under the surface, many people are grieving the loss of their former lives. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the kind of grief you feel when a loved one dies‚Äîit‚Äôs grief created by so much uncertainty. We liked the way things were,‚Äù .</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, this trend toward the practice of mindfulness is not new. But what‚Äôs changed this year is the number of people who‚Äôve become aware of the importance of taking care of themselves in order to better cope with life‚Äôs ups and downs.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Moreover, this important turning point in the mental health and wellness landscape has been widely understood by large companies, many of which now offer their employees the opportunity to integrate &nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs take a tour of some companies that have ridden the wave of Mindfulness to improve not only the quality of life, but also the productivity of their employees.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-mindfulness-at-work-5-major-companies-that-implemented-mindfulness-into-their-corporate-cultures""><strong>Mindfulness at work: 5 major companies that implemented mindfulness into their corporate cultures</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindfulness is now practiced in companies with a range of different activities. Here, you‚Äôll see proof that  is finally considered a necessary practice for these  and their companies!</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-nike-sports""><strong>1. Nike (Sports)</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The international sports company has chosen to offer its employees the option to practice wellness activities in the workplace, such as mindfulness and yoga. To do so, they have opened rooms dedicated to relaxation and employ professionals who regularly offer guided meditation sessions.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-apple-technology""><strong>2. Apple (Technology)</strong></h3>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For Steve Jobs, meditation and yoga have always been essential elements for a balanced life. In fact, he said that these practices helped him be his best self and develop his creativity, one of the Apple founder‚Äôs greatest strengths.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So naturally, he decided to share his passion for meditation and yoga with his employees by offering them 30 minutes of dedicated practice a day in the relaxation rooms provided for this purpose at the Apple offices.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-3-goldman-sachs-finance""><strong>3. Goldman Sachs (Finance)</strong></h3>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindfulness is taking hold in banks, too! The international investment bank Goldman Sachs decided to teach the practice of Mindfulness to its employees so that they can avoid stress through building resilience.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As William George, ‚ÄúThe main business case for meditation is that if you‚Äôre fully present on the job, you will be more effective as a leader, you will make better decisions and you will work better with other people.‚Äù Employees add that Mindfulness allows them to have a clearer mind at work as well.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-4-astrazeneca-pharmaceutical""><strong>4. AstraZeneca (Pharmaceutical)</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This large pharmaceutical company saw the practice of mindfulness as a great way to cope with long work days. In addition to offering mindfulness programs to its employees, the company funds research programs on mindfulness practices as well.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-5-meditopia-of-course""><strong>5. Meditopia (of course!)</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, Mindfulness has a special place in Meditopia‚Äôs offices! Before the pandemic, employees could take time to meditate at work. Fortunately, the arrival of working from home has not changed those good habits. The Meditopia team organizes meditation sessions on Zoom and has even programmed reminder notifications to meditate (yes, we all need it) that everyone receives daily!&nbsp;</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We just saw 5 large, world-renowned companies that have integrated Mindfulness into their employees‚Äô daily work life. But today, the practice of Mindfulness in companies is no longer reserved for the biggest players in the world, whose employees can enjoy a game room and a relaxation area in their workplace.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">On the contrary, nowadays Mindfulness is practiced in small and medium-sized companies, and even in non-profit organizations as well. In fact, meditation sessions are no longer seen as mere ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù that trendy companies offer to their employees, but rather as an answer to a real need that more and more people are clearly expressing.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In addition, companies have realized that taking time for themselves to calm their minds and reconnect with their bodies has a significant impact on their ability to concentrate and make decisions. This is why offering employees the opportunity to relax in the workplace has become a must for more and more companies.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, we would like to know your opinion: do you think that the practice of Mindfulness is a good tool to better manage work at home? Do you practice it and if so, is the pandemic the reason why you started to practice? Share your experience with us, we‚Äôd be happy to hear from you!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being able to identify the resources we require to meet our own needs is one of the most important factors in maintaining the health of our . Knowing what we need and how to get it enables us to nurture both ourselves and our relationships.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-realizing-our-priorities""><strong>Realizing Our Priorities&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Most of us know that we need to hold space for being a romantic couple in our daily lives. Those moments we spare for quality alone time with our partners helps our emotional resources grow.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes, though, in our daily hassle, we may forget to center ourselves and/or our relationships. Our responsibilities may take over and become the determining factors of how we greet life each day, taking up our energy, space, and time. This can cause us to feel tired and stressed to the point where we can no longer identify the resources available to us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Perhaps we may find ourselves saying: ‚ÄúThis week went by like the blink of an eye,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúMy partner and I just don‚Äôt have time to do the things we want together,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúSometimes we can‚Äôt even make time to chat,‚Äù or,&nbsp; ‚ÄúI feel so tired, I feel like I can‚Äôt catch up with anything,‚Äù so much that they become our knee-jerk response. When we realize that these expressions have become the dominant pattern of conversation in our lives, we may reconsider what we need to change.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can begin to take back our power, disrupting the pattern by rearranging the boundaries between demands of the external world and those of our private lives. Releasing the burden of trying to catch up with everything, reevaluating our priorities, and reviewing where we put ourselves and our relationship on that long list can be helpful. Stepping back from our routine lives to identify our needs and how we are feeling turns our lives into a process we feel we can take part in rather than be dragged along for the ride. With practice and time, reorienting ourselves and reaffirming our boundaries and priorities becomes much easier.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-nurturing-our-resources""><strong>Nurturing Our Resources&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The quality of our communication with our partner can tell us a lot about the quality of our relationship. Ask yourself these questions: Do I feel like I‚Äôm being understood by my partner? Am I motivated to  with them? Do I think that they will be interested in what I say? Do I feel like I‚Äôm being heard?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our motivation for talking with each other and sharing how we‚Äôre feeling or what we need is closely related to whether or not we feel we‚Äôre being understood. We are more likely to share if we feel that the other person cares for us and is interested in our experience. By asking ourselves the above questions, we can begin to get a better idea of how we are able to communicate our needs in our relationship and what may need to change.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being unwilling to share, believing our partner doesn‚Äôt care about us, or losing interest in our partner can be indicators that something is blocking our sharing channel, the most fundamental resource for maintaining closeness in our relationships. These feelings can also show us what we need, which is not to ignore the blockage but to work toward finding a solution.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Barriers crop up in our relationship for a variety of reasons and every relationship has its own dynamic. That‚Äôs why it is so important to evaluate our relationships with our specific story and relationship history in mind. We can ask further questions of ourselves to deepen our understanding of how we‚Äôre feeling about our relationship in the present moment. Some of those questions could be: How long have I been feeling reluctant to share with my partner? How long have I felt as though they won‚Äôt understand or care for me? Can I recall a situation in particular that made me feel this way? Does my partner know how I feel? How does my partner experience this difficulty? Do they feel the same way? If so, how do they explain it? Time and context impact our relationships beyond just what we do within them. Our jobs, families, health, and traumatic experiences weave themselves into the fabric of our daily lives as well. How do these factors impact your relationship? Do they play a role in preventing closeness? If so, how can we prevent such factors from deepening the rift we may feel? How can we begin to cope with these difficulties?&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each of these questions can help us to understand the origins of feelings like resentment, desperation, and anger. These feelings can run deep and may trigger our self-defense reflex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we identify the problem areas which cause such feelings and find a solution for them, our relationships can become more trustworthy and enjoyable again because we have been reassured that our partner cares for and loves us. We care for our partner as well and feel willing to share with them. The question marks and worries in our minds fade away. Curiosity, desire, and trust are restored. In such an atmosphere, we feel more willing to share a life and ourselves with one another.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Imagine chatting, expressing yourselves, listening, and just enjoying one another‚Äôs company without feeling obligated to do anything. Think of basking in the desire for one another, creating time and space for having more fun, traveling, listening to music, dancing, watching movies, playing games, exploring new places, creating space for the marvelous, the surprising. Just like sustaining our wellbeing with self-care, our relationship needs our care as well. That‚Äôs why being aware of our resources and keeping them active is important. How are you nurturing your resources today?</p>

Our Relationship with Food üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What does eating mean to you? For many of us, it can mean to satisfy hunger, indulge, or sometimes it can accompany a feeling. Our relationship with food is closely related to our relationship with our body. Therefore, it‚Äôs helpful to remember that eating is more than just getting nutrients. Of course, our relationship with food may be disrupted from time to time at certain points in our lives. When this happens, we may start looking for solutions, as our body‚Äôs balance is thrown off as well. In this process, our false assumptions, beliefs, or strict diet systems can also create a nutritional imbalance and impact our mental health.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, what can we do about it?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-shift-toward-self-compassion""><strong>Shift Toward Self-Compassion</strong></h2> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Often, we may experience the constant whisperings of our inner critic, judging us and sometimes catastrophizing our reality. This voice may stem from our environment, family, friends, and media over the years and may become so internalized we begin to believe it is our own. Shifting toward self-compassion and positive self-talk can be powerful ways to combat our inner critic and improve our relationship with food.&nbsp;</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>&nbsp;I eat to nourish my body.</li> 
    <li>&nbsp;I am grateful for my body.</li> 
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am stronger than my worst moments.</li> 
    <li>&nbsp;I am worthy of love just as I am.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When your inner critic rears its head, trying to make its voice known, practice saying the above sentences to yourself. Our negative self-talk won‚Äôt immediately, or perhaps ever, disappear, but with practice we can center self-compassion and prevent or lessen the stress, guilt, and shame our inner critic can create around eating.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-make-peace-with-food""><strong>Make Peace with Food</strong></h2>

   </figure> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The more we forbid ourselves something, whether restricting ourselves or giving into diet culture, the more valuable it can become in our mind. Does this feel true to you? On the other hand, if we eat the same thing every day, we can get used to it and may not crave it as much. Therefore, it is important to find a middle ground which gives us both the opportunity to become familiar with and to desire.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our goal is not to try to eat the same thing until we get tired of it and there‚Äôs no one formula that works for everyone when it comes to food and eating habits. The goal, instead, is to create space for joy in our relationship with food, or, to at least reduce the harmful effects a negative relationship with food can have on our bodies and mental health.</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our body tells us to eat when we are hungry and to stop when we are full, just as it tells us to sleep when we are tired. That‚Äôs why we need to be in touch with our body while trying to improve our relationship with food. The inner body awareness that we can develop to help with this process is called ‚Äúinteroceptive awareness.‚Äù Interoceptive awareness allows us to recognize and understand signals coming from within our body.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our bodies can respond to physical hunger, social hunger, imaginary hunger, and emotional hunger, which all create a desire to eat something.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Physical hunger is the hunger we feel when we need food for energy. This type of hunger often intensifies the longer we wait.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Social hunger refers to the desire to eat as part of a social order. Here, the social aspect of eating food comes to the fore, rather than the energy source aspect.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Imaginary hunger is the state of craving caused by seeing, smelling, hearing, or thinking of the taste of particular foods. This can also pass after waiting for a time.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> is a feeling of hunger that arises in order to calm or suppress certain emotions or thoughts. Often, it appears out of the blue and when the emotion dissipates, the hunger lessens.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After identifying the source of our hunger, there are several ways to notice how full we are as well. Sometimes you may not notice the feeling of satiety if you are engaged with other things while eating, do not pay attention to the food, or if you are eating very quickly. To be more in tune with your body‚Äôs sense of fullness, you can turn off devices like the TV, your phone or computer, so that you can more clearly pay attention to your food. The practice of  allows you to get acquainted with how much you eat and which emotions you feel while eating. By doing so, you have time for your food and are better able to identify and follow the signals of your body. To get even further in tune with your body‚Äôs wants and needs, you can also practice focusing on your breathing, meditating, or journaling about your emotions as you think about eating.&nbsp;</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the things we can do to improve our bond with food is to enjoy it, to really savor the experience.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The first step is to ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat do I really crave?‚Äù What would you like to eat for the simple sake of enjoyment without letting that inner critic take over?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can then try discovering the pleasure that comes from the palate. The food we eat has so many characteristics from taste, to smell, temperature, and texture. You may find some aspects of your food more enjoyable than others.&nbsp; Maybe you gravitate toward salty, crunchy foods over sour and soft foods, for example.</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center"">

    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Third, you can make your eating experience more enjoyable by eating slowly, taking the time to appreciate your food. If possible, try to eat in a calm and pleasing environment. Instead of eating in the car or in front of the computer, try eating at a table, maybe even setting a place for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The fourth step is finding contentment, or what works for you. You can transform your relationship with eating and increase the pleasure you get from a meal as you notice your own eating habits and extend compassion toward yourself. Remember: The most important thing is to nourish yourself with joy and awareness and to treat yourself with love while doing so.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As Meditopians, we went on a journey on February 14, 2021. As a relationship therapist, Tuba Aydin accompanied us, bringing some helpful articles with her. These articles touched on how to feel secure in a relationship and the resources we have available to us that give us a better understanding of the . These resources can also help to identify communication barriers in the relationship, allowing you to share your feelings more comfortably. We will be posting these articles once a week for five weeks, starting with, ‚ÄúFeeling Secure in Our Relationships‚Äù. With this article, you can begin your journey toward learning more about your romantic relationships!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Feeling secure in our relationship with our partner has a big impact on our ability to lead a healthy life. A relationship in which we feel happy and secure nurtures our physical, emotional, and mental well-being, becoming one of our most fundamental resources. We can use this resource not only to reinforce what goes well in our lives, but also to get some support in difficult times. When we are with someone who is happy about our existence, who wants to share the different moments of life with us, who cares about the traumas we‚Äôve had, the feelings can become reciprocal. We care for them too and would like to support them in difficult times as well.</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A healthy romantic relationship does not interrupt our flow of life but rather makes us feel more secure and aligned with ourselves. This safety allows us to perform better in other areas of our lives as well. Our relationship can nurture us, strengthen our work, parenting, and social relationships.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, sometimes the healthy relationship we‚Äôve established can waver and become unsustainable. Our environment may change or the passage of time may lead to obstacles in our communication. Cases of misunderstanding can turn into vicious cycles of miscommunication that push us out of seeing our relationship as a safe and secure space.&nbsp; In such a situation, all the nurturing qualities of a healthy relationship may become reversed and we can feel restless, anxious, or troubled.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Experiencing a season of distance or discomfort in our relationships isn‚Äôt at all uncommon. Relationships aren‚Äôt formulas, there‚Äôs no equation we can put together to reach perfection and expecting to be able to do so would be unfair to both ourselves and our partner. We can begin to repair our relationships and prevent such rifts in our communication from growing by focusing on  in the present.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-sharing-our-needs""><strong>Sharing Our Needs</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the ways to preserve what is safe and nurturing in our relationships is to practice sharing and expressing our needs intentionally. Sometimes we can get so stuck in the minute of the day, the daily responsibilities, tasks, and future plans, that we can lose sight of what brings us joy, what lights us up about our connection in the present.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We need to feel loved, understood, and cared for in our relationships. That way, we know we are safe and secure. Identifying and expressing our needs beyond our shared responsibilities or the events of our workday can be a powerful way to maintain that connection. We can ask each other questions like: how are you feeling today? What makes you feel close to me? What needs do you have that aren‚Äôt currently being met? In doing so, we can observe one another and keep our interest awake and alive with fresh perspective and renewed curiosity.&nbsp;</p>

   </figure> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Knowing that we can seek support from our partner is actually another way we can continue sharing. The ability to share difficult experiences, knowing that we can rely on our partner to buoy us up through stress, anxiety, or fatigue, can be powerful. Being able to be there for one another strengthens our trust in our relationship and draws us closer together. This does not mean that within our partner resides the solution to our troubles, but rather suggests that they‚Äôll be there as a confidant, someone who sees and hears us with curiosity and interest, offering their help in their own way.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Just as it is so important to feel supported, it is also important to be able to ask for support. Some of us may not hesitate to ask for help from our partner. And for others of us, we may feel that asking for help makes us burdensome or that our request won‚Äôt be met and we‚Äôre less likely to reach out for that . When we find ourselves in these situations where we‚Äôve got the impulse to overcome everything alone, we can end up pushing our partner away, excluding them from our inner lives.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we reflect on our own reservations about needing and asking for help, we can explore ways to resolve any obstacles that may come up. By doing this inner work, we can protect our energy and maintain open, sincere, and trustworthy communication.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-allowing-conflict""><strong>Allowing Conflict&nbsp;</strong></h2>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Allowing for the possibility of disturbances and/or conflicts in our relationship is another way to maintain our well-being. We will disagree, we will argue, and we may hurt each other‚Äôs feelings in relationships. This is not an unfamiliar pattern for those who are close to one another. We may feel misunderstood, angry, or resentful and that‚Äôs okay from time to time. Of course, there are lines not to be crossed and patterns of abusive behavior we want to look out for and avoid. But healthy conflict does not mean the end of a relationship. In fact, the way we navigate conflict together as a couple can help us understand what we do well and where we might need to grow or change.</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We need to be able to express when we are feeling some resentment, if we need some space or time, our fears, concerns, or anger without acting destructively. This goes back to being able to share our needs. Sometimes our needs are born of conflict and that‚Äôs okay. It is okay to ask for what we need in order to move through difficult moments together and prevent further miscommunication from taking root.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In times of stress, our capacity to embrace our emotions and to calm ourselves plays an important role in navigating conflict. Therefore, we can positively contribute to both our individual well-being as well as the health of our relationship by trying to improve our own emotional regulation processes.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A romantic relationship exists outside of the two people who share it. That is, just like the individuals within the couple, the relationship itself has strengths, vulnerabilities, and patterns or habits that have been shaped over time. The health of our relationship affects us just as we have an impact on it through our actions and behaviors. Maintaining a  depends on many things such as our environment, the subsystems we are in contact with, and many other factors in our lives. What needs to continue, change, or stop for your relationship to feel safe and happy? For you to say, ‚ÄúI am safe and happy where I am‚Äù? If we are willing to continue our relationship and it is not doing us harm, we can always explore the possibilities of our own growth both individually and together, full of potential.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each of us experiences being a student at some point in our lives. Some of us have the opportunity to pursue education for many years and some of us don‚Äôt find traditional schooling at the center of our lives. That said, being a student can extend into many facets of our lives whether it be learning a new task, subject, or discovering deeper parts of ourselves. Being a student can involve enthusiasm, responsibility, and dreams, depending on who you are and what value you attach to learning. What does being a student mean to you? Think about the other roles you have right now‚Ä¶ Maybe you‚Äôre someone‚Äôs child, cousin, friend, parent, or perhaps someone‚Äôs significant other. Where does your role as a student stand in your life? Is it a leading part or a minor character? Get in touch with yourself‚Ä¶What responsibilities do you have as a student? What methods do you use in order to fulfill those responsibilities?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-becoming-aware-of-your-academic-needs""><strong>Becoming Aware of Your Academic Needs</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If we consider , it can be a bumpy road. You may experience obstacles, needing to recover from losses as you continue on your way. What do you need to take with you along this road? Who would you like to be beside you as you travel down your academic path?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Think about your space. What do you need while studying? A clean and tidy environment or a calm atmosphere? How about music or white noise to help you ? Perhaps you need your favorite snack? Notice your surrounding environment while you work. Are there any objects, sounds, or smells that make you uncomfortable or cause distraction? What time of day do you have the most energy toward learning?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before starting to study, pay attention to the needs of your body, making your surrounding environment comfortable, adjusting the volume of ambient sound if possible, and making sure that there are no odors or objects around that could distract you.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Every path we walk has an eventual end. Think of your main goal that drives you, your main source of motivation. Remember that each step you take toward meeting your own needs is a step closer to achieving your goal.<strong> </strong>Hold tight to your ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù what keeps you walking down this road. What is at the end of your path? Visualize it, closing your eyes and imagining yourself there, having achieved all you wanted to achieve.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Remember, the more specific and clear your goal is, the more clearly you can see whether or not you‚Äôre achieving it. When setting a goal, make sure it‚Äôs attainable and try giving yourself a deadline. Unrealistic expectations can cause you  and worry, so if these emotions are cropping up, consider revising your original goal.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Making a plan is like plotting a map of your route. In an unfamiliar place, if you don‚Äôt have a map in hand, your chances of getting lost increase. The roads may twist and turn, you may get confused, panic, and start feeling like you want to run away and abandon the trip entirely.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Start planning by thinking about what kind of path you‚Äôd like to proceed with, how much time it will take, and what materials you‚Äôll need to get where you want to go.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-prioritizing-tasks""><strong>Prioritizing Tasks</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Go over your list of tasks. Is each one connected to a different subject or on a different level? You may find some easier to tackle than others. Every step you take may not be filled with equal enthusiasm and motivation. Some steps may require more effort to maintain your balance. Sometimes you may prefer running to walking. Sometimes your body will need a break, will need rest.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What‚Äôs the most important task on your list? How are you going to take the first steps to accomplish it? Having a list and a plan for how to navigate it can help to mitigate your worries and increase your motivation. Can you assign numbers to your tasks, organizing them based on priority?&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-unfinished-business""><strong>Unfinished Business</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our unfinished tasks can frequently take up space in our minds. Maybe we ignore them, choosing to postpone or focus on other things, and yet, those tasks we haven‚Äôt completed don‚Äôt go away. On the contrary, our unfinished work can create stress, waiting there and continuing to needle us. What does it feel like to finish something? Remember the last time you completed a task.<strong> </strong>Maybe you finished a meal, a walk, or a good book. How did that feel? Is it possible that you‚Äôll feel similarly when you‚Äôve finished your tasks at hand?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-notice-your-inner-voice""><strong>Notice Your Inner Voice</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Is there a voice criticizing you while you‚Äôre studying, setting high expectations for you? Often, we are our worst critics, mercilessly pulling ourselves down. We sometimes even label ourselves as ‚Äúunsuccessful,‚Äù or a ‚Äú.‚Äù Do you ever label yourself in this way? Notice the thoughts that cross your mind and how you‚Äôre talking to yourself during study time. Witness the flow of your mind and take stock of the emotions that fill your heart.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When you criticize or label yourself, you can start to believe these thoughts without question. Try to catch all of these judgments about yourself. Sometimes we form patterns of self-criticism through our childhood experiences, hearing voices that echo throughout our minds as we grow up. These voices can become one, melding into the one voice we hear within ourselves and sometimes doing us harm. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to talk to yourself in a positive tone, grounding yourself in reality.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-postponing""><strong>Postponing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Postponing, delaying, or procrastinating often manifest when we choose other pleasurable activities over our academic tasks or pursuing our learning goals. Maybe that means we‚Äôre taking a nap, watching TV, working out, wandering around, or doing something that seems much more appealing than getting things done. What are the reasons behind your procrastination? Could constant procrastination have a negative impact in the long run?&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-taking-responsibility""><strong>Taking Responsibility</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">While studying, you may feel bored, uninterested, or like you‚Äôre having a difficult time staying focused. This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre inadequate, lazy, or entirely lacking motivation. You‚Äôre not going to want to study all the time and that‚Äôs okay. It can be helpful to remind yourself why you‚Äôre studying and ask yourself: What will happen in the end if I don‚Äôt?&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs your choice to begin, ignore, and also to complete a task. It‚Äôs your responsibility. What does that word, ‚Äúresponsibility,‚Äù mean to you? Do you think you are taking enough responsibility?<strong> </strong>In what situations is it difficult for you to take responsibility? Sure, there are short-term, instant-gratification benefits of not studying, of focusing on pleasure and leisure. What about the long-term?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Are there situations in which you feel more comfortable taking responsibility? For example, do you enjoy walking your dog or changing your cat‚Äôs litter? What about going to school? It is very unlikely that we‚Äôll get the same amount of joy from all activities. Sometimes fulfilling certain responsibilities can be joyful while others can be boring.<strong> </strong>What can be appreciated here are the steps taken on the road toward your goal, seizing responsibility despite the potentially boring nature of the task.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I wish you happy responsibilities!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs no secret that one of the greatest icons of technology, Steve Jobs, meticulously practiced meditation. Regular meditation practice was not only a real boost to his creative juices, which were known to be overflowing, but also a great way for him to manage stress and keep his mind clear.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">He once said, ‚ÄúIf you just sit and observe, you will see how restless your mind is. If you try to calm it, it only makes it worse, but over time it does calm, and when it does, there‚Äôs room to hear more subtle things‚Äìthat‚Äôs when your intuition starts to blossom and you start to see things more clearly and be in the present more. Your mind just slows down, and you see a tremendous expanse in the moment. You see so much more than you could see before.‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Steve Jobs practiced Zen meditation and mindfulness for many years, a habit that can be directly related to his success.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">She once asked a meditation teacher to instruct the entire film crew how to practice a particular meditation technique, saying the results were incredible. She recounted the impact of this practice on the set of The Dr. Oz Show, saying that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt imagine what has happened in the company. People who used to have migraines, don‚Äôt.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For Weiner, the practice of meditation has become so indispensable that  mindfulness is the, ‚Äúsingle most important productivity tool,‚Äù he uses every day! This precious time spent taking a step back from his own ideas and objectives is what allows him to pursue greater success in collaboration with his team.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúMindfulness is not just about our minds but our whole beings. When we are all mind, things can get rigid. When we are all heart, things can get chaotic. Both lead to stress. But when they work together, the heart leading through empathy, the mind guiding us with focus and attention, we become a harmonious human being. Through , I found a practice that helped bring me fully present and in the moment, even in the most hectic of circumstances.‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is the story of five influential leaders saying loud and clear that meditation is one of the most important tools accompanying their success, day after day.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes, while working at an intense pace, we don‚Äôt notice the passing of hours or even days. We may find ourselves so occupied with work that our thoughts are consumed by it, even when we are not actively working. Many of us view work as a process that must be endured in anticipation of better days yet to come. However, when we internalize this point of view, we can allow life to roll on by without living it to the fullest.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-can-meditation-contribute-to-work-life"">How can meditation contribute to work life?</h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can reframe our work lives from a tool we only tolerate in order to get by or to save for the future to a resource that brings us joy, energy, and even nourishes us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes we may feel so overwhelmed by our jobs that we can‚Äôt imagine doing this again and again each day. We may spend time scrolling through new job postings on career websites in the hopes of finding something better, or even just something different. Practicing  is a strategy to increase awareness that can help to create that relaxation and refreshment we crave without having to change our jobs.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, what are some of the direct benefits of meditation on our career lives?</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-managing-your-stress""><strong>Managing Your Stress&nbsp;</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many of us crave positivity and joy in our lives, wanting to avoid intense or stressful periods. Who doesn‚Äôt want a carefree and peaceful life, right? Though this is a common desire and totally understandable, often the periods in which we learn the most valuable lessons are those where we experience hardship. It can sometimes be difficult to stay in those challenging moments and having the patience to do so when all we may want is to be free of them is almost half the battle. One of the ways we can begin to manage our stress is by staying in the present moment and observing our emotions.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> conducted at Uludaƒü University showed that people who regularly practice mindfulness exercises such as yoga and meditation reduce their stress levels, often have higher paying jobs, and greater life satisfaction compared to those who do not. Another study conducted with academics showed that as mindfulness practices increased, so too did happiness as well as the ability to implement strategies to cope with stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In light of these findings, taking a break on a busy or stressful work day, even just for a couple of minutes to give mindfulness a try can have a great impact. Try starting with some !&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-increasing-your-psychological-resilience""><strong>Increasing Your Psychological Resilience</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôve all had bad days at work. Sometimes, when we‚Äôre experiencing challenging moments at work, it can have an even more intense impact on us, especially if we‚Äôre already stressed in our lives outside of work. It can be helpful to recognize that this is temporary, that you will not feel like this forever, allowing yourself space to build up your mental resilience. A showing  intervention improves psychological well being and productivity</p>

   <figure class=""wp-block-image size-large"">  
   </figure> 
   <div style=""height:33px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">. In other words, the suggestion is that the more one practices mindfulness, the stronger one‚Äôs psychological resilience will be.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">At first, it can be hard to believe that stress is temporary, accepting the intense and challenging situation as it is. However, you can develop this acceptance and patience through regularly observing your body and thoughts without judgment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-managing-feelings-of-inadequacy""><strong>Managing Feelings of Inadequacy</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most common feelings we may face in our work lives is that of inadequacy. Since childhood, we may have had goals to achieve, obstacles to overcome, and stairs to climb. We may have felt the need to cross a threshold, progress, or be better than others in order to believe we are successful or that we are good enough. Especially nowadays, demonstrating efficiency and success have become even more important criteria. Because of this, we may have a hard time accepting ourselves as we are as we‚Äôre too caught up in the desire to be efficient and successful.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If this situation sounds familiar to you, don‚Äôt worry you‚Äôre not alone. Remember, you are worthy no matter what you deserve to feel good. You don‚Äôt need an excuse or an achievement to be compassionate to yourself. Sometimes meditation can be a safe space to remind yourself of your worth when feelings of inadequacy creep up on you. Over time and with practice, you can reach a point where you embrace and accept all of yourself. You can look at yourself from a more objective and compassionate perspective when you‚Äôre feeling unsuccessful or inadequate.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-feeling-free-to-rest""><strong>Feeling Free to Rest</strong></h3>

   <div style=""height:23px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We often realize too late that we need to rest. We may delay addressing that need, letting our energy drain without realizing it. Sometimes we‚Äôll ignore even our most basic physiological needs like drinking water, moving our bodies, going to the bathroom, and more. You may realize that you become aggressive or nervous during such moments, reacting differently than you would otherwise. Mindfulness practices can help you identify and address your needs by checking in with yourself from time to time. Taking a break, even if for a brief moment, can help to fulfill both physical and mental needs when you‚Äôre feeling stressed and irritable.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being aware of your boundaries can also help you to create space for rest when you need it. It can be difficult to balance boundaries between work and personal life, especially if we work from home. shows that there are positive relationships between mindfulness and work/life balance as well as mindfulness and job performance. This  indicates a positive relationship between workplace mindfulness and job performance and negative relationship between workplace mindfulness and turnover rate. That is, the more mindfulness we practice, the greater our performance and the less mindfulness we practice, the more we may see an increased turnover rate.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When practicing mindfulness and sticking to your boundaries can help you to perform more freely, with joy, and in accordance with your own capacities and desires.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-considering-establishing-your-boundaries""><strong>Considering &amp; Establishing Your Boundaries</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The sector or institution you work for may require you to be in connection with various people throughout the day. You may work with a lot of people you don‚Äôt know well or with whom you don‚Äôt have deep connections. Sometimes, you may establish unhealthy patterns of communication when you‚Äôre experiencing challenging or stressful . Maybe a comment or reaction from a coworker or supervisor makes you upset and it may feel difficult to express yourself and maintain your boundaries.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By practicing compassion and acceptance, it is possible to be yourself despite challenging relationships and to establish patterns of communication through respecting both your own and the others‚Äô boundaries. Your colleague is a person with strengths and weaknesses, just like you. Realizing this can enable you to evaluate the behaviors that upset you from a more objective perspective. Mindfulness practices can help you prioritize yourself, identify and communicate your needs and what you will and will not accept. Thus, you can name those situations that upset you and clarify your needs, providing clear feedback while also contributing to a pleasant work environment and team spirit.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a doubt, one of the major factors impacting our job performance is the ability to focus. In a study conducted in 2020, after two years of  education, a significant increase was observed in the attention spans of students participating in the experiment. In another  examining the concept of mindfulness, findings were compiled showing that mindfulness contributes to focus, emotional regulation and intelligence, job performance, and constructive conflict resolution processes. Based on these results, we can see that mindfulness practices open the door to possibilities of a happier, productive, and creative business lives.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-bottom-line""><strong>Bottom Line</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all may experience the loss of motivation and enthusiasm in our working lives every once in a while, feeling disconnected from what drives us. In such moments, it‚Äôs important to treat yourself with compassion and to gently remind yourself that this is temporary. When you think about the past few weeks, in which of the above areas do you think you‚Äôre having the most difficulty? Remember, recognizing your needs is the first step toward fulfilling them.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What would you say if I told you that instead of a cup of coffee, you can use some  to feel awake and refreshed? In Yoga, all breathing techniques are tools used to regulate and increase our life force energy: the prana. That is why these techniques are called ‚Äúpranayama‚Äù or the . Some pranayama practices help lower tension, calming our system and bringing us into a meditative state. There are some other pranayamas that increase your heart rate, boost your energy and mood, and wake you up. Get ready, because in this article I‚Äôll tell you all about these highly beneficial exercises.</p> 
   <div style=""height:25px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

    </div> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:23px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs first discuss the effects of breathing techniques on both the body and mind. What comes to mind when you hear the words ‚Äúboosting‚Äù or ‚Äúenergizing‚Äù? What kind of color or feeling do those words evoke for you? Initiating, directing, or leading energy is usually associated with the fire element in most philosophies. Think of : you have earth (matter, mass) and you have water (the binder). When you bring earth and water together to make a pot, let‚Äôs say, it won‚Äôt maintain its shape unless you fire it. Breathing techniques bring up the fire qualities within us, firing our metabolism, boosting our energy, helping our digestive system to work properly, and pumping up our immune system. Just like we may add spices to our food to liven up the flair palate, add a pinch of turmeric and just a little ginger to refresh your body!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before we get to the how of these exercises, I have a few gentle reminders:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Your body and health come first!</p> 
   <div style=""height:32px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

   <div style=""height:29px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you have high blood pressure, heart issues, or any health concerns that might be triggered by rapid breathing or increased heart rate, please be careful. Some of the exercises listed here are very gentle, but listen to your body every step of the way and don‚Äôt push it too hard! Exercises are listed from gentle to most powerful so follow the order if you‚Äôre not sure what your limits are yet. If anything doesn‚Äôt feel right for your body, take a step back and try a gentler technique.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-preparing-your-stomach""><strong>Preparing Your Stomach</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Pranayama is best done on an empty stomach and with empty bowels if possible. However, if you are prone to dizziness when hungry, you can try these exercises a couple of hours after your meal. So, not too hungry, not too full.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-energy-boosting-breaths-physical-activity""><strong>Energy Boosting Breaths &amp; Physical Activity</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I strongly encourage you to make use of these techniques before you exercise, especially if you are going to engage in high effort cardio activities like running or power yoga. You might be surprised by how much they positively impact your performance and provide a smooth transition into peak effort.&nbsp;</p>

   <div style=""height:27px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Also, adding these techniques to your  would be a great idea, particularly if you‚Äôre wanting clarity of mind and  before you start working.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, let‚Äôs start with the Crocodile Breath technique!</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-crocodile-breath""><strong>Crocodile Breath</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The Crocodile Breath technique gets its name because it requires you to be in a position that resembles a crocodile! The main idea here is to teach our body to use our diaphragm muscles more, relaxing the shoulders as we breathe. This helps to increase your breathing capacity and aids in easing muscle tension, particularly useful before a training.</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Lie on your stomach with your ribs touching the floor.</li> 
    <li>Put your one fist on top of the other and rest your forehead on the upper fist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Relax your shoulders, releasing them toward the ground.</li> 
    <li>Try not to inhale into the upper part of your chest to avoid elevating your body away from the floor through the expansion of your ribs.</li> 
    <li>Instead, inhale through the nose into your belly in order to expand your lower torso on all sides. Your stomach, lower back, and side abdominals should expand.</li> 
    <li>Hold the breath for one to two seconds.</li> 
    <li>Breathe out through the nose trying not to strain your body.</li> 
    <li>After you have an understanding of the movement, continue this exercise for a couple of minutes.</li> 
    <li>&nbsp;There is no specific requirement as to the duration of the breaths for this exercise, but try to maintain your normal flow with equal counts for both your inhales and exhales.</li>

   <div style=""height:33px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h1 id=""h-lion-s-breath""><strong>Lion‚Äôs Breath</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Lion‚Äôs Breath is a basic yet powerful breathing technique and position, with a warming effect. If you‚Äôve seen a lion‚Äôs face in a documentary or movie, you know that they open their jaws wide to let out a roar or a deep yawn. We will practice the same movement during this breathing technique. You will exhale with a ‚Äúha‚Äù sound as though you are trying to fog a glass or warm your hands in the cold. You can try exhaling like this before actually starting the exercise. When you exhale deeply, mouth agape, it is often warmer than usual.&nbsp;</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>In a kneeling position, sit back on your feet, spreading your knees wide with your big toes touching slightly underneath you.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>First, breathe normally for a couple of breaths to find your usual rhythm.</li> 
    <li>Then, place your palms on your knees, splaying your fingers wide.</li> 
    <li>Roll your shoulders back and down away from your ears, maintaining this position for the duration of the exercise.</li> 
    <li>Your spine should be long as you lean slightly forward with a relaxed yet active back.</li> 
    <li>Inhale deeply through the nose and begin exhaling from the mouth slowly, making the ‚Äúha‚Äù sound. Try emptying all air in the lungs by using your ribs and core muscles to push the breath out.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Be careful not to strain or collapse your shoulders.</li> 
    <li>Repeat steps #1-7 to understand the exhaling technique. Don‚Äôt feel silly opening your mouth as wide as you can. Nobody is watching you!</li> 
    <li>After getting used to this pattern, you‚Äôre gonna add a couple of things to the exercise.</li> 
    <li>On each exhale, stick out your tongue, lengthening the tip of it downward as you roll your gaze up between the eyebrows.</li> 
    <li>As you inhale, allow your body to expand through a small backbend, arching your lower back and your neck while continuing to look upward. You can use your hands pressing firmly on your knees for support.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can start with five repetitions of the full version and increase the frequency over time as you wish. Feel free to adjust the sitting position by bringing the knees together or by modifying it to a classic .</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-kapalabhati""><strong>Kapalabhati&nbsp;</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Did you know that ‚Äúkapalabhati‚Äù in Sanskrit actually means ‚Äúskull shining breath‚Äù? Kabhalabhati is an intense practice and if you practice it long enough you may actually feel a little tingling sense building in your forehead, just as if your skull is shining. Don‚Äôt worry, I promise you won‚Äôt burst into flame! Having an empty stomach is especially important for kapalabhati and it is not recommended to practice during the first few days of a menstrual cycle.</p>

    <li>Sit in the with your hips on your heels, knees together or in a cross-legged position. Use cushions to help you sit tall if needed.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Contracting your belly, exhale forcefully. Imagine squeezing a balloon and emptying all of the air inside of it. Do not inhale, instead release your belly, allowing the air to fill back in.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>This movement might be confusing if you haven‚Äôt tried it before, so practice it a couple of times to get used to the rhythm. Focus on exhaling quickly by sucking the belly in and do not focus on inhaling, rather letting it happen naturally as you release your belly.</li> 
    <li>Once you‚Äôre comfortable, try this exercise about 30 times to start.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If 30 times feels good, you can take a rest and do one or two more sets. As you get more comfortable, you can speed up the rhythm or increase the number. After finishing all sets, close your eyes and observe your body and breath for a couple of minutes. You may realize that your breath has slowed down, maybe even to the point of stopping (kumbhaka). This sometimes happens because the body gets rid of excessive carbon dioxide and becomes saturated with oxygen, lessening the need to breathe for a couple of seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> is especially beneficial for gut health and when you‚Äôre feeling bloated or constipated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <h1 id=""h-bhastrika""><strong>Bhastrika</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In some resources, Kaphalabhati &amp; Bhastrika are used interchangeably. However, I will tell you how  differs. It is a powerful technique that has more of a heating and boosting effect than Kaphalabhati. It is recommended that you try this technique before heavy physical activity and to help when you‚Äôre feeling sluggish. You‚Äôll hold your arms aloft the entire exercise, which can accelerate your heart rate. The hard and perhaps slightly weird part of this exercise is making the wolf growling sound in the throat. Let‚Äôs get into the details.</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Sit in a cross-legged position and raise your arms gently in a ‚ÄúV‚Äù or ‚ÄúU‚Äù shape, relaxing your shoulders.</li> 
    <li>Your arms should be gently yet actively reaching toward the sky, spreading your hands wide.</li> 
    <li>Take a couple of regular breaths.</li> 
    <li>Inhale fast and forcefully.</li> 
    <li>Exhale fast and forcefully, bending your elbows down toward your hips and making your hands fists and lowering them in line with your shoulders.</li> 
    <li>Inhale, sending your hands to the air and exhale, lowering the elbows and hands again.</li> 
    <li>Find your rhythm and repeat this ten times.</li> 
   </ol>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After you get used to it, you can add the sound part. Try exhaling very forcefully and making a sound like growling or as though you were clearing your throat. You can increase the count or add more sets to your Bhastrika practice as you grow more comfortable. Be careful not to strain your body and try sitting up tall the whole time without stressing your neck.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now you know a couple of powerful tools to boost your energy, your mood, and immune system. Don‚Äôt wait too long to give them a shot! We would love to hear your experience with these breathing exercises in the comments below!&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Because we‚Äôre spending so much time on ‚Äúdirected attention‚Äù activities through our screens, phones, and at work, we need to disconnect in order to create new patterns of attention for ourselves. When heading into refreshing surroundings outside, <em>don‚Äôt</em> bring your phone. This way, we can begin spending time in nature and receiving its benefits with intention and focus.  from Harvard Medical School has revealed that spending two hours a week in nature can have powerful health benefits such as reducing stress and anxiety. So, <em>do</em> try to recharge yourself outside and embrace the beauty of the nature around you.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many philosophers, artists, and politicians spend time walking in nature to get new ideas. As we spend time outdoors, we release endorphins which are associated with pleasure and our wandering thoughts tend to slow down when we take in natural surroundings. Maybe new growth on the trees around you inspires you to write, paint, or start something with a fresh perspective. By opening up our mind, heart, and soul to nature, we can spark our creativity and welcome those new ideas.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>Restoring Ourselves in Nature&nbsp;</strong></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes, when we feel lost, we may find ourselves stuck on our screens or on our phones in search of some relief or direction we may or may not get. Spending time in nature, particularly through silent meditation retreats, can help to restore us to ourselves, reconnect to our soul, and build resilience in order to face the world anew. Nature, while powerful, does not judge us&nbsp; and we can focus on the beauty of the trees, the stillness of the woods, the calmness of the rivers, feeling out the full extent of our emotions. Walking mindfully in nature can also provide&nbsp; health benefits such as reducing cardiovascular risk, deepening our sleep, and improving our general health.&nbsp;</p>

As we  in fresh air and feel the grass beneath our feet, our connection to the earth deepens and we can remember that nature will be here for us through the best and worst moments of life. Through observing nature, we can begin to open ourselves up to deeper meaning from experiencing love, to accepting ourselves, to moving on from the past, and more. Tranquility and reflection await us in nature if we can embrace its true spirits and work to foster our connection with ourselves.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As part of my daily meditation practice, I often spend time in nature both alone and with friends in order to absorb new energies. I grew up surrounded by trees, animals, and energies that built up my creativity. Whenever I felt sad or lonely, I wandered around parks, listened to the birds, and watched the sky, feeling restored, rejuvenated and like I could move on with my grief. Walking two hours in the woods has given me great relief from stress and anxiety and has allowed me to open my heart to welcome the present without judgment. Grounding myself in nature, I feel more connected to myself and my spiritual practice, making me stronger, more joyful, and present.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can allow ourselves to reconnect and enjoy our truest selves through nature. It‚Äôs possible to relieve our body, mind, and soul from worries and open ourselves up to love and joy in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It can become difficult to keep up the joyful rhythm of the dance. Perhaps someone , misunderstood, or unloved and may react to an issue instead of respond. When we react automatically without trying to understand the other person‚Äôs needs, that can exacerbate feelings of being unseen and unheard. Try to notice your automatic reactions.

   <h2 id=""h-expressing-your-feelings-needs""><strong>Expressing Your Feelings &amp; Needs</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Whenever there‚Äôs something your partner is doing that upsets your or makes you uncomfortable, can you communicate your feelings and needs without criticizing them? Trying to express yourself can bring you closer together, even when conflict arises. Using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements can be very helpful when navigating more difficult moments. For example, saying things like, ‚ÄúI feel worthless when you talk to me without looking me in the eye,‚Äù instead of, ‚ÄúYou are so disrespectful when you talk without looking me in the eye.‚Äù Using ‚ÄúI‚Äù statements allows you to more clearly identify your own feelings and needs and opens up communication for your partner or partners to do the same.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being mindful of our words and gestures when we‚Äôre talking with our partner or partners can help to prevent feelings of humiliation or shame. Shaming one another should not be a practice in healthy, communicative relationships. How can you express your own needs without bringing others down? Can you appreciate the positive traits of your partner or partners while also communicating what you need?&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A romantic relationship shouldn‚Äôt be a competition. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúreward‚Äù for winning an argument or proving yourself to be ‚Äúright‚Äù. The hope is that all parties involved , seen, and heard in the relationship. Sometimes, when our partners are communicating their needs, we may feel defensive, or an impulse to prove we weren‚Äôt in the wrong. Instead of reacting defensively, can you pause for a moment and consider the information communicated by your partner or partners? Can you approach the issue from a place of inquiry, of seeking to understand? Taking responsibility for the harm we may have caused may feel uncomfortable at times, but all discomfort leads to growth and can sometimes  between you and your partner or partners.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you find yourself wrestling with the impulse to respond defensively, try to take some time and space for yourself. Maybe you ask your partner or partners if you can revisit the issue in a few hours or the next day when you‚Äôve had some time to process your own feelings and needs. This can be a helpful way to navigate conflict in the moment instead of stonewalling your partner or partners by refusing to address the issue or broach the subject. When you‚Äôre able to , you‚Äôre more likely to understand one another. Other strategies you can practice in order to relax are mediation and breathing techniques.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs talk about mind reading! Mind reading is a guessing game in which you make assumptions about what‚Äôs going on in your partner or partner‚Äôs mind and accept those assumptions as fact. Sometimes, those assumptions might look like, ‚ÄúThey seem sad. I must be boring,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre upset because I can‚Äôt make them happy,‚Äù and so on. , feelings, and emotions aren‚Äôt directly communicated, then people in the relationships can become increasingly distant from one another. Understanding your partners‚Äô needs and being able to express your own is crucial to forming healthy connections. Ask your partner or partners about their needs today and try to take note of your assumptions beforehand, comparing the response afterward to determine how your assumptions played out. Is the reality different from the one you‚Äôd imagined in your head?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Think about your models for . Did you observe any of the above mentioned communication barriers? Maybe you saw your caregivers shouting at each other, shutting each other out, or making assumptions about one another? What verbal and non-verbal behaviors can you identify? Do you have people watching you or seeing you as a model? Think about how your relationship is acting as an example for those around you or those in your care. Can you strive to understand your partner or partners without criticizing, shaming, becoming defensive, or stonewalling, and instead express your feelings and needs?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are environments in which we may feel comfortable and peaceful like: a corner of our home, beside our loved ones, or somewhere we can be alone. One of our most fundamental needs is intimate relationships in which we feel accepted and supported. When we feel accepted, we can rest in the sense of knowing we will be free of judgment and our body can begin to relax. Well, how do you know if you are accepted and free from judgment? The answer to this question varies for everyone. While some of us may perceive a glance as a threat, some of us may find social environments threatening and our perceptions can stem from our childhood. If we experienced trauma in our childhood, or if we felt unsupported, made fun of, etc. we may carry a negative self-perception around with us.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-is-social-anxiety""><strong>What is social anxiety?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Social anxiety, also known as social phobia, occurs when an individual believes that they will be judged, ridiculed, or excluded and can result in excessive worrying in social contexts. If you are running through worst case scenarios in your mind before, during, and after social experiences, if you feel yourself in a thought spiral about what others will think of you, and if you feel tense and anxious just reading this, you may be navigating social anxiety. If these feelings affect your daily routines, relationships, and other areas in your life, making you uncomfortable, you can begin to consider how you‚Äôre talking to yourself, recognize your scale of judgment, and start to implement strategies to relax.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When you experience extreme social anxiety, everyone can appear as a potential threat, critic, judge, or perceived trigger. In fact, this experience is not inherent within us, as the belief that we will never receive approval and acceptance can be rooted in that which we did not receive in our childhood. Yet, no child deserves to be excluded or disapproved. <strong>The inability of your childhood environment to give you the support you needed does not make you ‚Äúflawed‚Äù or ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù. </strong>The approval of others is not the basis of a person‚Äôs existence or a reflection of someone‚Äôs character.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>The impact of social anxiety on the body and mind.</strong></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It may become difficult for you to speak up and express your opinion in a meeting full of people or perhaps it‚Äôs become impossible to eat alone in the crowd, feeling threatened and like everyone‚Äôs eyes are upon you. The threat here is being judged, criticized, or disliked by others, appearing flawed and worthy of rejection. This fear of rejection can become so intense that anxiety spreads throughout your body and you may not know what to do. You get so worried that you‚Äôll draw attention to yourself and your feelings through becoming flushed, trembling hands, or a stutter that the thought of someone noticing your anxiety manifesting prevents you from seeing what‚Äôs happening around you. The higher the social anxiety, the greater the perceived social threat.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you are experiencing , you may notice that beside feelings of inadequacy and unworthiness, you may have a hard time relaxing, truly resting. So, try to pay attention to your own thoughts and assumptions: could your belief that you will leave a negative impression on others prevent you from being yourself and finding a place of calm?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-strategies-can-help""><strong>What strategies can help?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><strong>When the tension in your body increases, notice it, take a moment to sit with those thoughts running through your head.</strong> You cannot read other peoples‚Äô minds, however you can notice your own and test their accuracy. It is unlikely that others around you are constantly watching your every move. Look around and observe them. What are they doing? What is their purpose? Are they there to judge and criticize you? <strong>Are these people truly threats?</strong></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What‚Äôs going on around you? Who‚Äôs there? What are you saying to yourself in that moment? How is your body reacting? can be very healthy and useful when it comes to better understanding yourself. That said, fixating on yourself excessively can reduce your openness toward others, at times making it difficult to communicate and socialize. Imagine that you were monitoring everything about yourself and had to sustain that effort through an entire meeting while still participating. That kind of focus can be exhausting and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important to look to the outside world with curiosity.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Being able to  as you are is a big step forward. There is no other you in this world and you don‚Äôt have to be like others. You are an individual. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>You are you. What someone else thinks of you doesn‚Äôt make you less valuable or less important and you don‚Äôt need to feel embarrassed for being your most authentic self. You are valid.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a child, a moment of embarrassment can become an experience that sticks with us throughout our lives. If this feeling is one you feel often and have trouble coping with you can seek support from a clinical psychologist. Intense emotions can keep cropping up again and again when we don‚Äôt work on them. Sometimes the solution is just to get in touch, to share your feelings. Have you ever tried sharing something you‚Äôre ashamed of with someone you‚Äôre not close to? Come on, you can take the first step today.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Altering your thoughts can help alter your mood, altering your mood can help you find calm. As you calm down, your body relaxes and you can feel freer and more at ease. Once you prepare yourself for the social environment and take baby steps in the setting that worries you the least, you then have the chance to test whether the catastrophic scenarios are true possibilities.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Did the scenarios you were afraid of come true? Can you be less critical of yourself? Can you accept yourself as you are? Try to stay in the present moment and ask yourself: Are the people around me really dangerous? Are they too hard to handle? Along with identifying the possibilities around you for discomfort, take a look at the positive. Do people engage in positive, kind behaviors? Maybe there are people around you who smile at you and seek out genuine conversation. Being neutral can be difficult at first, but the more you experience finding even ground, the easier it will be to manage your anxiety. Try to see the conditions as a whole, filled with both pros and cons.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before moving into the warm and fuzzy side of this article, let‚Äôs take a look at some cold hard facts. It may seem strange how the simple act of hugging can impact feelings of pain and depression, yes?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Well, there‚Äôs a hormonal explanation for it all! When you hug a person, the brain secretes oxytocin, also known as the attachment hormone. Side note, I‚Äôm talking about a <em>real</em> hug here, because a pat on the back won‚Äôt cut it. The duration of the hug must be at least 20 seconds to enjoy its benefits!&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once secreted,, the hormone, and relaxes our muscles, reducing pain. As if that wasn‚Äôt enough, hugging reduces blood pressure as well, creating the perfect wellness cocktail!&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-secret-of-a-successful-hug-intention""><strong>The secret of a successful hug: intention.</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, not all hugs are the same. Although the idea of a hug may seem pleasant, some hugs are not as affectionate as others.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we‚Äôre not emotionally invested in the person we‚Äôre hugging, the exchange does not have the same effect. I‚Äôm thinking about those hugs where you feel a little bit forced, like when adults push children to hug their peers or another adult or when we feel pressure to hug someone when we may not be open to touch at that moment. Although these hugs may have been offered with good intentions, the emotional exchange is not as powerful as a cuddly hug with someone you feel close to, trust, and love, for example. The intention behind giving and receiving a hug has a significant impact on the benefits that can be derived from that experience.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In order for the in response to a hug, the intention behind wanting to hug or to receive a hug from someone must be filled with love and grounded in the present moment.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So the next time you have the chance to hug someone you love, make sure you‚Äôre not making a shopping list in your head, or projecting yourself into your next activity. Take a deep breath and let the magic of affection carry you away.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Did you know that the Japanese have invented a technique to recreate the feeling of being cradled in our mother‚Äôs womb? Indeed, it‚Äôs called Otonomaki.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Actually, the primary purpose of this technique is to relax the back muscles. To do it, you have to be wrapped in a cloth sheet of any kind, while being in the fetal position‚Ä¶ It may sound strange, but it seems to be very soothing for both body and mind!&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A journalist tried the experiment during a trip to Tokyo. Although she was skeptical at first, she came out of it completely relaxed, with a strong desire to</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The reason for this is that the sensation of being tightly held, here again, transports us to our oldest memories: those of our arrival on earth, warm and safe, in mom‚Äôs womb.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In such an environment, our mind can then settle down, because it no longer has any reason to worry, and it feels taken care of.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">While stress is an inevitable part of our lives, it has transformed into a lifestyle for many of us during this time in which we are living. From intense work pace, financial concerns, anxiety both present and future, long to-do lists, and various expectations, stress can take root.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs be clear, although we all have a certain amount of knowledge when it comes to stress, we may find it difficult to apply strategies for how to manage it in practice. It is not always easy to  when we are stuck in traffic while trying to get to a highly critical meeting, when we come to a breaking point in our romantic relationships, or when we have debts to pay off.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The good news is that it‚Äôs up to us to change our relationship with stress. It is possible for us to accept stress as a natural part of life, to understand it instead of ‚Äúfighting it off,‚Äù to discover the role of stress in our lives, and to continue walking our path as our truest selves.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-understanding-stress""><strong>Understanding Stress</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stress is our body‚Äôs natural reaction to external physical or psychological stimuli. , the state of balance or equilibrium within our body, can be disturbed when faced with stress. Our body makes internal changes in order to adapt to the external environment. The system that manages these changes is known as the sympathetic nervous system. During a moment of stress, the sympathetic nervous system takes over and the commonly known ‚Äúfight or flight‚Äù mechanism comes into play. As a result, chain reactions occur in our body such as an increase in heart rate, sweating, dilation of the bronchi, rise in blood pressure, and muscle contractions. When the physical or psychological stressor disappears, our body activates the parasympathetic nervous system through the ‚Äúrelax, digest,‚Äù command transmitted from mind to body to return to homeostasis.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A rather recent finding about stress is the crucial role that the  plays in the parasympathetic nervous system. The vagus nerve is our longest cranial nerve and sends parasympathetic nerves to our heart, lungs, stomach, small intestine, liver, pancreas, and many other organs. Unlike the chain reactions generated by the sympathetic nervous system during stress, the vagus nerve tries to regulate our breathing, heart rate, muscles, digestive system, circulation, and even our vocal cords to again return us to homeostasis.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This means that our body has an advanced mechanism that enables us to act in times of stress and to calm down afterward. However, this system is not exactly the same for each of us. None of us experiences stress the same way and we can react and respond differently to various stressors. For instance, some of us may experience stress tied to our breath and breathing, while others may find it manifests through the contraction of muscles. These variations can be shaped by other our genes and our lived experiences.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">How do you experience stress? Which part of your body do you feel stress most intensely? How do you respond to stress? Answering these questions can be a good start to getting to know and understanding your relationship with stress.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-discover-the-role-of-stress-in-your-life""><strong>Discover the Role of Stress in Your Life</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Recall one accomplishment that means a great deal to you. Try to visualize all the details of that experience in your mind, remember how you felt, try to feel those sensations that awakened in your body in that moment. Now, remember the path you took to achieve that accomplishment. Was it an easy, smooth, and short path? Or, was it more challenging and filled with obstacles? Which emotions accompanied you on this path? Which emotions motivated you? Think about how stress served you in that process, how it contributed to what you achieved.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Could the fact that you are feeling stressed mean that you are actually improving, growing, trying something new, and exploring your limits? When we get stressed during a difficult task, we may instantly feel like something negative is happening. The task we are doing may seem impossible, difficult, boring, overwhelming, and exhausting. This can result in our motivation to decrease and sometimes we may give up. The uneasiness and stress of new things can be due to the body‚Äôs instinct to protect itself against a possible threat. Therefore, it is natural to feel stressed when faced with a challenging new task, new habits, or new responsibilities. When we are outside of our comfort zone, we can experience stress. This just means you are trying something new and trying to discover your potential and your limits. As Adam Braun said, ‚ÄúTrue self-discovery begins where your comfort zone ends.‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stress is an important source of energy to unlock our potential.  have found that short-term stress enhances memory and improves mental performance. It has also been found that stress increases our emotional resilience, strengthens our social ties, and plays an important role in determining our priorities and . Additionally, stress strengthens our immune system and even helps us combat disease.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stress creates important contributions to both our development and performance. So, how might your experience of stress positively add to your life? Maybe you discovered a new perspective or achievement as a result of stress. Beginning to answer the question of how stress has positively impacted your life can help you better understand how stress manifests for you.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Timber Hawkeye says, ‚ÄúYou cannot calm the storm, so stop trying. What you can do is calm yourself. The storm will pass.‚Äù When our body and mind are in harmony, we feel ourselves  and in the flow. Thus, no matter how strong the storm is outside, we can experience calm within our body‚Äôs limits. So, how do we achieve this harmony? The following suggestions may be helpful:</p>

   <h2 id=""h-smiling""><strong>Smiling</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First of all, I would like to tell you about my process of writing this article.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I have experienced various emotions while writing. My first feeling was a tremendous sense of happiness. The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeing a member of the Meditopia family truly excited me and I immediately got to work. It was not that difficult to choose the topic as I thought it would be widely applicable, since each and every one of us experiences stress that directly affects the quality of our lives. So far, so good.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs get to the writing phase. As I was trying to examine the topic, to employ the correct language, to find the most useful information for my article which I had started with great excitement, the only feeling I was experiencing while writing an article about stress was stress. After some thought, I found this ironic situation funny. I laughed to myself.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Would you believe me if I told you that after that smile break, my mind relaxed, then my hands loosened, which I had tightened without even noticing, and the words started to flow naturally?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">But why do we relax when we smile?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, our mind receives the message, ‚ÄúEverything is fine, I‚Äôm safe.‚Äù This causes an increase in endorphins and serotonin, known as the happiness hormone, while reducing cortisol and adrenaline, known as stress hormones, in our body. As a result of all these natural changes in brain chemicals, we feel better and happier.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You might be wondering, ‚ÄúHow can I laugh when I‚Äôm stressed?‚Äù In fact, we don‚Äôt have to feel good all the time to smile. Sometimes we can smile just to feel good. It is under our control to use these muscles. The good news is that our brains cannot differentiate between a real smile and a smile of pretend. While you are smiling, the signals that you feel happy, pleasant, and comfortable are sent from your body to your brain. The brain then assumes that this is true. If you want to try it right now, form a soft and natural smile on your face and wait for one minute. Observe how you feel.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Make lots of excuses to smile throughout the day. Reading a funny article, watching an entertaining movie, or spending time with your pet if you have one, can be perfect for this. For me, it‚Äôs been the humorous posts on social media that helped me reduce the stress and anxiety I‚Äôve experienced during the pandemic.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-listening-to-our-body""><strong>Listening to Our Body</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our body reflects our thoughts and feelings. In other words, what we feel in our body carries important information about ourselves and our needs.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we are stressed, we may contract many of our muscles without even noticing. In fact, the body does this as a reflex in anticipation of injuries and pain that may occur at the time of a threat. The small moments of stress that we experience in our daily routine affect our muscles as well, causing us to feel physical pain and discomfort over time.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes we feel these pains are negligible or that we can just keep it moving. However, listening to the messages our body gives us is important in terms of making sense of what we experience.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Well, what does your body tell you today?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The shortest way to communicate with our body is through our breathing. You can think of the breath as a bridge between you and your body. Every time you breathe, you connect with your body a little bit more, getting closer to yourself. For this experience, you can try the  below.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can let your focus wander around the parts of your body while taking deep breaths in and out. Observe your body with curiosity and compassion. Notice&nbsp; your breath as you scan your facial muscles, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, back, waist, chest, heart, abdomen, hips, legs and feet. Listen to your body‚Äôs messages.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is possible to strengthen your relationship with your body by noticing your physical sensations and observing the changes you experience. The strength of this relationship gives you balance and stamina when dealing with challenging emotions such as stress.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Remember that we are all unique. Therefore, how we experience stress, how we respond to it, and what is good for us may also differ.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So what‚Äôs good for you? Will you share with us?</p>

   <h3 id=""h-introduction""><strong>Introduction</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Every organism responds to their environmental conditions. As humans, we have unique responses to everything we‚Äôve been through, every aspect of our lives. We all know that being stressed can be a physical response and impact our state of being. When we strive for relaxation, we‚Äôre searching for that stress-free zone that includes our hormonal and nervous systems along with our mental well being. Our very muscles and bones can indicate that we‚Äôre stressed. For example, when we experience pain, distress or uneasiness can manifest themselves in our joints or tendons. In this article, you‚Äôll learn some of the breathing exercise that may help to alleviate your stress and guide you into that stress-free zone! Why is shifting our practice of breathing particularly effective? Does it require a lot of ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù? Let‚Äôs discover the answers!</p>

   </div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What does being relaxed really mean? Let‚Äôs first start by exploring what not being relaxed looks like, by defining . The actual definition of stress is pressure or tension exerted on an object. Playdough, for example, reconfigures its shape based on the force applied. We humans are malleable. We move, we break, we change. We may experience stress in different forms and our responses to that stress can shift as well. Sometimes we may be moved to finish a task or project in order to lessen our stress. Or, perhaps the pressure is too much and we need to reach out for help. Our nervous system is a fundamental part of creating, regulating, and executing responses to our external world. If we can get to know our nervous system better, we may be more equipped to regulate our stress responses during particularly tough moments.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The function of our bodily systems is greatly dependent upon our breathing. One of the quickest ways to check the health of our bodies is by looking at our breath. Our breathing patterns can change based on perceived danger or risk, maybe we begin to breathe more rapidly or maybe we find it difficult to catch our breath. This is our nervous system identifying a moment of unrest. When we breathe more regularly, our nervous system translates that to mean everything is chill. As we regulate our breathing, we can suggest to our nervous system that everything is fine and give ourselves space to reach a sense of calm.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now that we understand why breathing is so important for our bodies, how our breath can impact our thoughts and feelings, let‚Äôs identify some breathing exercises.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-proper-breathing""><strong>Proper Breathing</strong></h1> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before getting into the details of the many different breathing techniques, let‚Äôs determine the most effective way of breathing. Maintaining effective breathing is essential for practicing the breathing techniques we‚Äôll describe later correctly. Unless specifically necessary, breathing should always be done through the nose. Our nose is a specialized organ made to filter and moisturize the air we both inhale and exhale. The air outside of our lungs is much drier and filled with particles and organisms such as dust, bacteria, pollen, and more. The mucus layer inside of our nose helps to prevent congestion and works to lessen the risk of infection.  and mindful breathing keep our respiratory tract cleaner and healthier and can reduce uncomfortable symptoms and allergic reactions in the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The second most important part of our body that‚Äôs involved in our breathing process is the diaphragm. We often hear the phrase, ‚Äúdiaphragmatic breathing,‚Äù which is a misconception as the diaphragm is in constant use as we breathe, so there should be no such distinction. Our diaphragm divides the lungs and abdomen from other organs. So, when the lungs fill with air, the diaphragm expands downward, pushing the abdominal muscles to expand out to the sides. If you take deep enough breaths, using the lower part of your lungs effectively, your belly should expand rather than your chest. Using this lower part of the lungs is the practice of breathing that people usually call ‚Äúdiaphragmatic breathing,‚Äù but the air follows the same pathways. Let‚Äôs discuss some other ways you can better feel your lungs and breathing muscles before we move onto the specific techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Try lying down to your back on a rather empty stomach and start to intentionally relax your tummy. Really connect with your belly, your ribs, your sternum. Start by feeling around your belly button to see if your abdominal area is tight. Is it easy for you to push your fingers into your stomach? A tight belly is an indicator of a stressed body. Remember, we tend to close down our posture to protect our internal organs when we‚Äôre in fight and flight mode! If it feels tight, that‚Äôs not an unusual experience. Now, start trying to relax the muscles around there. To do this, you can suddenly tense your muscles like someone‚Äôs going to punch you and then quickly relax them. Try to do this a couple of times and let your belly expand so that you have room for air. Observe how the air fills in and out without trying to control it. When you relax your belly, you‚Äôre telling your nervous system that you are not in danger. Calming the nervous system can relax the body, mind, and emotional state overall.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the next step, start to feel how the body‚Äôs contact with the surface you‚Äôre lying on shifts or changes. Do you feel more weight? Do you feel more contact? As the last step, sit up and bring your hands to the sides of your rib cage. Try to breathe in, expanding your rib cage and pushing your hands outward <em>without tightening your belly. </em>This is the type of movement we want to have when breathing in in our daily life. If we don‚Äôt use these small muscles around the ribs, they can grow stiffer and more immobile with time, reducing our ability to take deeper breaths. I assure you your breathing behavior will start to change little by little if you practice each day. Let‚Äôs check out some specific forms of breathing exercises.</p>

   <h1 id=""h-relaxing-breathing-techniques""><strong>Relaxing Breathing Techniques</strong></h1> 
   <h2 id=""h-pursed-lip-breathing""><strong>Pursed Lip Breathing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This technique is among the funniest and easiest of them all. Often, we may feel rushed in our bodies and with our breath. The main purpose of this particular exercise is to elongate the duration of our inhales and exhales. As we slow the pace of our breath and extend breathing time, we may improve our lung capacity, lower our blood pressure, and find a sense of calm.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To try this technique, sit anywhere that you‚Äôre comfortable. Make sure to relax your neck, shoulders, and jaw, taking a normal breath through the nose with your mouth closed. Now, purse your lips, as though you were going to blow up a balloon and start exhaling slowly between the lips. By narrowing our lips, we limit the amount of air we can expel and therefore slow the flow of air naturally. Try this at least four to five consecutive times to get the technique right. You can repeat this exercise everyday and increase the frequency with time. Habits are more likely to develop through consistency, but you can employ this technique when you feel tense or uptight to help navigate that moment. To practice this exercise consistently, choose the same time each day to give it a try.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-box-breathing""><strong>Box Breathing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Box Breathing is an effective breath regulation technique. The reason it is called ‚ÄúBox Breathing‚Äù is because the technique requires that we inhale and exhale for specific counts, to form the shape of a box. We‚Äôll inhale for four counts, hold it for four counts, exhale for four counts, and hold it for four counts.&nbsp; In this article, I will tell you a different way of applying the technique that may deepen your practice. Don‚Äôt worry! While it may seem confusing at first, it‚Äôs an easy exercise once you have the pattern down.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The basic version of the breath is:</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>After exhaling completely, inhale slowly as you count to four.</li> 
    <li>Hold the breath for another four counts.</li> 
    <li>Exhale slowly as you count to four.</li> 
    <li>Hold the breath for another four counts.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, the breathing cycle looks like this:</p>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can start by trying this sequence four to five times and observing the effect on yourself. You can always adjust the repetition count to best meet your needs.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the second version we will build on this box technique gradually by following these steps:</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>After exhaling completely, inhale as you count to four, and exhale as you count to four. Repeat this for three rounds.</li> 
    <li>Now, inhale for four counts, hold it for four counts, and exhale for four counts. Repeat this for three rounds as well.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Inhale for four counts and exhale immediately for four counts, this time holding it at the bottom of your exhale for four counts. Repeat this for three rounds as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Finally, do one breathing sequence following the original box version and repeat it three times.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The overall pattern of these sequence will look like this:</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:31px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is one of the ancient yogic ‚Äúpranayama‚Äù techniques. It is said that we have two energy channels called  that surround our spine and start from our two nostrils. Therefore, if we balance the two sides of our nose, the breath will end up balancing two sides of our body as well as the qualities the dual energies represent. The main idea here is to bring awareness to the balance between the two nostrils and to slow down our breath, bringing to the upper respiratory tract.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To start, you will use your right thumb, ring, and little finger. You can either leave your middle and index fingers relaxed towards your palm, or if you want to make the ‚Äúmudra‚Äù symbol, you can point them and press lightly between your eyebrows as you breathe.&nbsp;</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Sit in a comfortable position and release all the air from your lungs.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Close your right nostril with your thumb and inhale slowly from the left nostril. Finishing the inhale, release the thumb gently while pressing to the left nostril with ring and small finger.</li> 
    <li>Exhale through the right nostril and this time continue inhaling from the right nostril again.</li> 
    <li>After completing the inhale, gently press the right nostril with your thumb and open the left nostril, exhaling slowly. This is one complete cycle.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a beginner, you don‚Äôt have to count while inhaling and exhaling. Try doing this exercise around ten times. You may close your eyes if that feels comfortable for you. My advice is to do this breathing later in the day or when you need to quiet your mind. It helps to slow the body, cool the mind, and more importantly, it brings awareness to the two different sides of your breathing tract!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">(PS: If it is more comfortable for you to use the left hand you can reverse everything and start from whichever side you wish.)</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-4-7-8-breathing""><strong>4-7-8 Breathing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This technique is definitely my personal favorite as it helps me fight my  from time to time. Basically, you inhale for four counts, hold it for seven counts, and exhale for eight counts. Getting the pattern right may be difficult the first couple of times, but with patience and practice, your body will find its natural rhythm. The logic behind this technique is to saturate your body with oxygen and push yourself to take deeper breaths in a shorter amount of time. The elongation of the exhale, similar to the Pursed Lip Breathing, helps to relax the body and calm the mind. Try doing this sequence at least eight to ten times to observe the effect fully. If you intend to use this technique to improve your ability to fall asleep, try practicing even more frequently to see if it works for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-bonus-anuloma-viloma""><strong>Bonus: Anuloma Viloma</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Actually, ‚ÄúAnuloma Viloma‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù are ancient names for the Alternate Nostril Breathing technique. However, most of the time the ‚ÄúAnuloma Viloma‚Äù technique is applied with specific counts of breath. You can think of this as a combination of Alternate Nostril Breathing and the 4-7-8 Breathing (or the Box Breathing) above. So, if you are not new to the breathing exercises and if it is not confusing for you, you may try applying the Alternate Nostril breathing with an inhale, hold, exhale pattern that follows a one:four:two sequence. What that means is, if you inhale for two counts, you should hold it for eight counts, and exhale for four counts. Here‚Äôs how the sequence maps out:</p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Gently press your right nostril with your right thumb and breathe in through the left nostril for a count of two. With or without closing the left nostril, hold the breath for eight counts.</li> 
    <li>Release the right thumb and exhale from the right nostril for four counts. Start inhaling again from the right nostril for two counts.</li> 
    <li>Hold the breath for eight, release the left nostril and exhale in four counts This is one complete cycle.</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One reason to extend the duration of holding our breath is to allow the blood circulation to carry oxygen to parts of our body with maximum efficiency.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We hope you have a chance to try these techniques and that you find them helpful! Please share your experience of practicing these breathing exercises if you are able to! Have you noticed any improvements? Are you feeling more relaxed and calm?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Although we may make our New Year‚Äôs resolutions with great hope and enthusiasm, we may also find it difficult to follow through with these resolutions after the first few months. Setting goals can be easy, but sometimes the execution presents challenges. Being unable to stick to our goals can leave us with feelings of defeat, disappointment, and frustration. Those resolutions that brought with them a fresh sense of newness may turn stale when we fall short of our expectations. So, what is the solution? How do we avoid letting ourselves down?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can start by reframing how we think about goal-setting, resolutions, and change. Last year was difficult on both a personal and global scale for all of us in different ways. Even still, there was joy. Two things can be true at the same time. We can feel both pain and excitement just as we can experience  and calm. We exist in multitudes and how we approach a new year cannot, therefore, be a formula, but rather an opportunity to step into the messy authenticity of our truest selves.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One strategy that may be helpful as we enter the new year is to reflect. What practices of self-care served you during 2020? How did you nourish yourself? Where and how did you experience pain? These are just some of the questions you can begin asking yourself to unpack how you‚Äôre feeling. Sometimes a solitary journal practice can feel cathartic. Or, maybe you thrive when you can process your emotions with the support of close friends. What‚Äôs most meaningful for you? How did you identify and express your needs this past year? How do you want to meet your needs moving into 2021? When we are more aware of our own needs and habits of care, we are better able to ground ourselves in the present and carry those practices with us into the future.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-knowing-your-own-boundaries""><strong>Knowing Your Own Boundaries</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we hear the word, ‚Äúboundary,‚Äù we may call to mind images of barriers or an emphasis on restriction. When we‚Äôre talking about personal boundaries, however, we‚Äôre clarifying our own needs, what we will and will not accept. We may feel an urgency to produce a litany of goals when we‚Äôre being pummeled by advertisements advocating for resolutions and changes. Ask yourself: to what, to whom, and in service of what am I giving my energy to this year? Then, a step further: why? If you run yourself ragged at the behest of societal pressure to perform, you‚Äôre not going to be serving yourself and you may extend past your own personal boundaries.  exist to keep us safe, to help us form more meaningful connections, and to remind us of our purpose. Maybe that means our list of goals amounts to one small thing we‚Äôd like to accomplish, maybe we‚Äôre just trying to survive, or maybe you‚Äôre tackling big projects in this next year. Knowing what we have the energy for, what we are willing and unwilling to do in service of others and ourselves, will help us to approach what we want to do in the new year‚Äôs authentically and realistically.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-do-your-research""><strong>Do Your Research</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Much as new things may excite us, they can also be full of unknowns. Ambiguity can be challenging for us to navigate, making the idea of goal-setting difficult. Taking slow steps to dig deep about what you want to do in the new year‚Äôs can be helpful. Rest in the process of conceiving the idea rather than its immediate implementation. Do your research. If you want to start a practice of journaling, what items do you need? What kind of pen is your favorite pen to write with? Do you prefer lined or unlined pages? Identifying the materials that best fit your needs, whatever you endeavor to do, can help you more easily incorporate that practice into your daily life.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-let-your-past-guide-your-present""><strong>Let Your Past Guide Your Present</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">While incorporating new things into our lives can be tempting, recovering lost ground and grieving missed opportunities is important for us as well. What did you miss out on in 2020? How are you giving yourself space to grieve that loss? Sometimes resting in the feelings of discomfort can help us to see the way forward, to clear the cobwebs from our mind. Upon reflection, is there a way you‚Äôd like to see those missed opportunities recreated in this next year? Making New Year‚Äôs resolutions doesn‚Äôt have to be rooted in the creation of something new. Rather, it can be about recapturing an experience you wanted to have in the year prior as your current self.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-use-positive-language""><strong>Use Positive Language</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The way we talk to ourselves is powerful. If you‚Äôre considering New Year‚Äôs resolutions, make sure to ground your  For example, instead of saying, ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt get distracted,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt eat those things,‚Äù try saying, ‚ÄúI will focus on my mental health,‚Äù or, ‚ÄúI will nourish my body‚Äù instead.&nbsp; This shift can have a great impact when we‚Äôre trying to accomplish anything, big or small.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Writing about how we‚Äôre feeling and going into detail about how we‚Äôre approaching this new year can help to move your resolutions from a cognitive to a concrete level. Naming how we‚Äôre feeling and what we hope for on the page creates a space for mental clarity and to reflect on potential obstacles we may face. When considering the setbacks that may occur, you can also begin to think about how you‚Äôll work through them and be present with yourself through that process. Remember, being flexible and gentle with ourselves as we think about this next year is so crucial to our personal growth. Perfection doesn‚Äôt exist and life throws things at us that we will be unprepared for and that is okay. Leave it all on the page as you think through your plans, if any, for what you want to achieve in the new year‚Äôs and forgive yourself as you do or do not achieve them.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-navigating-motivation""><strong>Navigating Motivation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It can, at times, be motivating to contemplate how your resolutions will take shape in the next year. On the other hand, perhaps you‚Äôre finding it difficult to muster the motivation to achieve. During those moments, we can reach for external support. Maybe that‚Äôs calling a close friend or trusted confidant. Or, perhaps you reward yourself for an attempt, however successful, to buoy confidence in yourself.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Though it may seem simple, altering or shaping your surroundings in accordance with your goals can be quite effective. For example, you can post photos and affirmations in various parts of your room or around your space. These small changes can serve as reminders of what we want to do, our boundaries, our practices of self-care, our mantras, and more.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The New Year cracks the door open for us to become more aware of ourselves, reflect upon our experiences, and assess what kind of life we want to be living. How we respond to this invitation lives in how we create our own boundaries and make decisions that feel right to us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let this next year be filled with joy, where we can step further into our purpose as our most authentic selves!</p>

In this article, you‚Äôll find five ideas for that you can do with family and friends to have a great time that you‚Äôll remember long after!&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-paint-or-draw-your-emotions""><strong>1. Paint or draw your emotions</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Painting or drawing games can appeal to many, from the youngest child to grandparents! The idea is very simple and can really bring you closer to one another.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First, grab a sheet of paper for each person. Choose if you prefer to paint or draw, but either way: the more colors available the better!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Settle down together, then take a minute or two for everyone to close their eyes and get in touch with the moment. You can have a timer so that everyone can play the game of silence and ground themselves in the moment.</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When the alarm sounds, invite each person to paint or draw how they are feeling right then. If you‚Äôd like, you can set a specific time for the painting or drawing activity as well.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is important to make it clear to the participants that the goal of the game is not to create something pretty, but to express themselves freely using the shapes and colors that best suit their own feelings.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When everyone has finished painting or drawing, you can suggest that each person shows their creation in turn and that the others guess what emotion they‚Äôre expressing. This is a good way to talk about what you , through a fun and relaxing activity. However, if you think that some people will not be comfortable discussing and/or sharing their feelings, don‚Äôt hesitate to skip this step of the activity.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-cook-together-with-intention""><strong>2. Cook together with intention</strong>&nbsp;</h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here too, young and old alike can participate!&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Decide together whether you prefer to cook a sweet or savory dish (or both!). Next, each person must choose an ingredient that resonates with them that they would like to incorporate into the dish.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With the list of ingredients you have now selected, think together:, combining what you have chosen? Don‚Äôt limit yourself and try to combine flavors you‚Äôve never mixed before; it‚Äôs time to create and discover!&nbsp; And if you think it would be better to make two dishes instead of one, go for it! The idea here is for everyone to get involved and put their creativity to work for your culinary community!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-3-dance-with-your-eyes-closed""><strong>3. Dance with your eyes closed</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What if we added some music (and laughter) into the mix?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Depending on the mood of the group, choose music that resonates. Do people need to let off steam? Maybe something with a heavier beat. Do people want to relax and move slowly? Maybe choose something with a soothing melody.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Invite everyone to stand up and move around the room so that everyone has enough space to dance around at their own pace.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The idea of this activity is for everyone to  with their eyes closed and  so that they can really feel every move they make with intention and awareness. In addition, the fact that everyone closes their eyes allows all participants to move freely without worrying about other people‚Äôs gazes. Because this activity is similar to the drawing activity, you are not there to dance well, but rather to consciously release your body‚Äôs energy!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once you arrive at your destination, it‚Äôs time to observe: everyone has to name the insects, birds, plants, flowers, and trees they find on their way.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We are getting ready for a new year. Around this time each year, we begin to reflect on what we‚Äôre leaving behind and what experiences and dreams we hope for in the future. This year, we know, has been a difficult time for all of us. Perhaps it feels daunting to look forward to next year, to imagine a different reality, or build up the energy for excitement. It is absolutely okay to sit with those feelings of uncertainty or unease and also make space for the possibility of joy. Let‚Äôs envision a , grounding ourselves in strategies of self-care, flexibility, and compassion.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-look-for-flexibility-when-setting-expectations""><strong>Look for flexibility when setting expectations</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all have dreams and expectations when we are welcoming a new year. Often, these are the things we would like to change within our lives and ourselves. Sometimes, we manage to meet some of our expectations and sometimes we give up after trying, forgetting the goal entirely. When we hold ourselves too rigidly to our goals, one of two things may occur. Either, we experience a sense of defeat because we‚Äôve set unrealistic goals that cannot be met, or, upon striving toward our goals, we recognize that the result isn‚Äôt how we‚Äôd imagined and give up. Maintaining a lens of flexibility when it comes to setting expectations can help us to set goals that directly respond to our needs, which can be ever-evolving. Think of planning for the new year as if you were inflating a balloon. Perhaps we can‚Äôt get enough air into the balloon in order for it to take flight. Or, maybe we‚Äôve overestimated our strength and the balloon bursts. With this new balloon, we are more intentional, filling and releasing air as needed in order to soar. This kind of flexibility allows us to face our goals with an open mind, to know that it is okay for things to shift, change, and grow.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-embracing-your-authentic-self""><strong>Embracing your authentic self</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With so many noises around us, it can be difficult at times to embrace our authentic selves and identify our own needs. This is your reminder: you are worthy of your own greatness. The steps you take to center what you want and who you are, are meaningful. It is okay to dwell in solitude to reconnect to yourself. Creating a safe space to be alone with your truest you is brave when there are so many out there trying to tell us who to be and how to act. You get to determine the pace at which you move forward on your . Don‚Äôt rush the process.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-make-room-for-storytelling""><strong>Make room for storytelling&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most powerful skills we possess is the ability to create a story. Stories are the narratives we tell ourselves about our own reality. They can be the mirrors through which we see ourselves and the windows into understanding others that show us we are not alone. Try to imagine yourself in the new year. Where are you? What are you doing? Who are you with? What story are you creating for yourself? Practice being open to the possibilities, the differences that may take shape in the tale you‚Äôre telling and the wonders that may await you in this new year.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-focus-on-what-you-have""><strong>Focus on what you have</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As we reflect on the past year, we may find ourselves feeling a deep sense of grief or loss. Allow yourself the space for those feelings. It is okay not to be okay. At the same time, notice your strength. You are here, existing in your pain. Think of the people, places, and things you have that bring you joy. Claim what lights up your life just as much as your losses. Both experiences tell us we are alive, that we can continue with intention and purpose.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-make-room-for-new-experiences""><strong>Make room for new experiences&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Starting over may not always be easy. Imagine going to someone‚Äôs house and finding a plant you like there. You‚Äôre given a cutting to take home and propagate, waiting for it to sprout before you plant it in a planter. Perhaps you‚Äôll be too excited and cut the propagation short, transferring it to the soil before its roots have begun to solidify, lengthening the growing process. Or, maybe you extend the sprouting period for too long and the roots don‚Äôt thrive in the new soil. You may not know what will take hold in life, when and whether the root will flourish in the way you guessed. But if you make room for something new, you will find more opportunities for growth and joy as you try.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Laughter can be the , creating a sense of joy and connection even amidst our darkest times. We all want to know that we are not alone. Perhaps we experience humor with a person close to us, or a character on TV, in a film, or book. Give yourself permission to laugh without guilt, shame, or doubt. Take space for exploring joy through humor to ground yourself in the present.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-don-t-forget-to-be-kind-to-yourself-and-to-your-body""><strong>Don‚Äôt forget to be kind to yourself and to your body</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Not everything goes well all the time. Try to be kind to yourself. Remember that your body gives you signals about its needs that require just as much  and care as your heart and mind. How you think and what you feel about yourself is important for a deeper connection to your authentic truth. ‚ÄúWe can be our own worst critics,‚Äù is a common saying for a reason. How can you observe the critic within and invite them into a different headspace with tender kindness?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">May 2021 be a beautiful year, where you take care of yourself, make new plans with hope, and remain flexible as you move forward in your authenticity at your own pace. Remember to stay open to new experiences and perspectives and to invite and embrace joy, laughter, and compassion. Happy New Year!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-critical-inner-voice""><strong>Critical Inner Voice</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our minds are by the world, with its interpretations, judgments and approach. Our family, school, work environment, popular culture and even‚Äìwithout us even noticing. We begin to judge ourselves via the perception of others. These external voices turn into our inner voice, especially during childhood and adolescence, and become the critical voice we hear in our heads. That is, until you realize that that voice is not real. That moment could be right now!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The good news is that your feelings of worthlessness can get better and change.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, where does this critical voice and feeling of worthlessness come from?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It rears its head when we experience difficulties; when we face challenges, or when we are lonely, tired or unmotivated, this can trigger our feeling of worthlessness. We feel rejected, offended, abandoned, we fail at our job, cannot communicate properly, we are misunderstood, and this leads to a feeling of inadequacy. We find ourselves somehow lacking, and start  in our daily life.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Do you find yourself comparing yourself to others? This is a mistake, because you are actually comparing your most unhappy, difficult, tired or anxious self with someone projecting a perfect image. We forget that life actually has its ups and downs for everyone. Everyone feels strong and competent sometimes, or weak and inadequate at others.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You are not alone. From time to time, everyone experiences self-doubt, doesn‚Äôt like themselves, feels left behind or lacking, just like you. We are all human beings and our minds have the same conditioning. You are not alone in any of these experiences.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-listen-to-your-inner-voice""><strong>Listen To Your Inner Voice</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Everything you see on the outside consists of assumptions you make about the lives of others. Don‚Äôt believe in these assumptions and tire yourself. It doesn‚Äôt matter how others are doing. What matters is how you feel about your own journey.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes, even if you‚Äôre not comparing yourself to others, you may simply withdraw and feel exhausted at the thought of being inadequate. This thought is just a distortion. It‚Äôs an assumption, a generalization and an example of catastrophizing. You have value just as you are. You can‚Äôt become more valuable by being better, doing bigger things and attracting more people. Your worth is already within you, with every breath you take. You are worthy just because you exist, and you deserve to be loved. There are times when we forget this, or don‚Äôt remember it often enough.</p>

When you start having negative thoughts, celebrate yourself. Looking at these critical thoughts requires a great deal of courage. And the more you recognise them, the more you realize that you can be free of them.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Every time that you hear that critical and judgmental voice, notice it. And remind yourself that it is not real; it‚Äôs just an old thinking pattern. Bring your attention to your breathing, your body, what you have and what you can do in life.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Feel your own worth, your unique existence, with every breath, again and again. You are loved, just as you are.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The coronavirus pandemic has required us to adapt to many radical changes in a short period of time. Although the virus continues to pose a threat to our health, we continue to adapt our living conditions while being conscious of its presence.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Routines play a crucial role in this rapid transformation process. During the pandemic, we are increasingly  and spending less time outside, and therefore spending more time than ever with our family members. This has the potential to help nurture our relationships, but it can also be tiring and wearing. It might be helpful to contemplate how this change in the quality and quantity of time spent at home has affected your relationships. It‚Äôs probably easy to see the positive results: watching movies and TV series together, sharing household chores, having dinner more regularly, or just simply seeing each other more often‚Äìunlike during the hustle and bustle of your pre-pandemic lives. These are just some examples of the aspects of being together that can be beneficial. However, you may have difficulty in  and time for yourself when you are constantly sharing the same space. More importantly, you may start to ignore your needs, thinking that bringing them up might hurt your partner. In some ways, there may be some truth in your fears, and your partner may experience your needs as a sign of rejection. If this happens, remember that being true to yourself is important, and is necessary to provide you the motivation you need to create opportunities to fulfill your needs. Think long and hard about these reasons, which have healthy foundations, and then share them with your partner. This will allow your partner to differentiate between being unwanted and your need to be alone. In the end, instead of being a disturbing situation for both parties, creating space and time for yourself will foster an ‚Äú‚Äù that can strengthen your relationship.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Your ability to create space for yourself shines a light on many other themes that impact your relationship. Every relationship has its unique narrative. This narrative has both good, nurturing and strengthening aspects as well as points that can cause strain. Difficulties can arise from many different issues; these can be everyday issues, but others may be much deeper, corresponding to your inner world. The subject of whatever is challenging you and your partner closely affects how you deal with that challenge. For example, you may feel more in control and rational about issues surrounding your daily life. On the other hand, you might feel more defensive and vulnerable when it comes to feeling safe, the need for intimacy and attachment. One way to cope with such difficulties is to be aware of yourself and your relationship. You can ask yourself the following questions: ‚ÄúHow do I tend to express my needs?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do I behave when I feel angry, hurt, anxious or nervous?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow do I express myself in such moments?‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow does my body differ from when I am relaxed?‚Äù , ‚ÄúWhat messages do I send to my partner via the speed at which I speak, my tone of voice, gestures, facial expression, and body language?‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo they correspond to what I am trying to say?‚Äù,&nbsp; ‚ÄúIn those moments, how do I look from the outside? ‚Äù, ‚ÄúAm I in the right state to listen to what my partner is saying ?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIf I am not in the right state, am I able to take a break?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhich thoughts tend to pass through my mind during our discussions?‚Äù. Such questions can help you recognise what may be preventing you from trying to find solutions to your problems. It is also possible to answer all these questions in the name of your partner and share what you have noticed with them. When you are feeling safe in your communication, sharing the points that are important to you (but without any accusation) will help your partner develop their own awareness concerning these issues.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The  due to the uncertainty and many other negative factors it creates. This stress load, which is sometimes obvious and sometimes more hidden, can cause tolerance levels in relationships to be lower than usual. Therefore, issues which would not be that difficult to resolve under normal conditions can become a problem due to the stress and anxiety experienced by both parties, plus their lower tolerance levels. This situation may cause more frequent communication problems and misunderstandings. This is why it is crucial to figure out what is  with your partner, and to look for ways to improve it.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Close relationships are one of our most precious sources of psychological and physical well-being. Therefore, in addition to protecting your relationship from the stress created by the pandemic, discovering the resources and strengths of your relationship will also help both of you to feel happier and safer. Sharing your feelings and thoughts about the process with your partner is one of the primary things you can do. Even just sharing your fears, concerns about the present and the future, questions in your mind, sadness, and frustration can help you experience the pandemic in a safer environment. In such situations, sharing itself is a part of the solution, and is the most fundamental way to strengthen your intimacy with your partner.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In, it is as necessary to create new ways to develop and nourish your relationship as it is to take care of yourself. Either at home or in safe places outdoors, you can share experiences that will sustain the joy and productivity of your relationship. You can see how you can adapt actions that nourished your relationship before the pandemic to our current conditions, and see what new experiences you can discover. It is easy to recognize the threat the pandemic presents to our safety, but our well-being consists of more than just keeping ourselves safe. Staying focussed on what brings you joy even in the current conditions will be good for both you and your relationship.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here are some tips on mindful cooking for both people who live to cook and those who just cook to live. If you already enjoy cooking, you can use these tips to make your experience even more joyful. And if you‚Äôre not that interested in making your own food, who knows, maybe these tips will inspire you to give it one more try. So, let‚Äôs find out what would happen if we approached cooking in a more mindful way.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-cooking-means-making-conscious-choices""><strong>Cooking means making conscious choices</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><br>Cooking, as we know, means and preparing them to put together a dish. The main difference between cooking and deciding to eat a pre-cooked meal (whether frozen or takeaway from a restaurant, for example) lies in the notion of it being a conscious choice.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Cooking means, and not just consuming what is given to us. So, by cooking, we take control of our health by consciously meeting both our needs and our wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, it can be fun to be simply served a meal without having to decide what to cook or eat. However, as in every aspect of our lives, it‚Äôs a question of balance. And to find this balance, we need to be involved in the process. So, let‚Äôs cook mindfully!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-first-step-to-mindful-cooking-shopping-mindfully""><strong>The first step to mindful cooking: Shopping mindfully&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The ingredients we have access to can radically change . This is very easy to prove: imagine you‚Äôre at home, you‚Äôre hungry and you don‚Äôt have much time to eat. You have no choice but to make a meal with the ingredients you have in your fridge and cupboards. If you find a microwavable pasta meal, there is a high chance that you will automatically pick that, warm it up, and eat it. It‚Äôs pretty obvious.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, if all you have are 2 eggs, some lettuce and a yogurt, you will have decisions to make.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">How will you prepare the eggs? Scrambled, sunny side up, boiled? As for the lettuce, will you use some dressing or only a bit of oil? Will you sweeten your yogurt? Immediately, there are decisions to be made. And these decisions will  and therefore take charge of your health, even when you don‚Äôt have a lot of time on your hands.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To cook mindfully, the first step is to grocery shop in a mindful manner. Yes! It‚Äôs simple: If you only buy noodles, then noodles is what you will end up cooking and eating. So it‚Äôs very important that you change the way you buy your ingredients by respecting the following points:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Make space for the high nutritional value foods that you like: noodles are good if you like them, but they‚Äôd be more nutritious in small quantities and mixed with vegetables, fruit, dairy products, and grains‚Ä¶</li> 
    <li>Choose the freshest and least processed ingredients.</li> 
    <li>Try new things: widen your horizons by occasionally buying some fruit you‚Äôve never tried or a kind of rice you have never tasted before, for example.</li> 
   </ul>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is how you can go from being a passive consumer to being an active participant in the way you eat!</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-is-it-important-to-cook-mindfully""><strong>Why is it important to cook mindfully?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, you now understand why choosing your ingredients is important. Well, the way you cook them is just as important! But, why exactly? Well, other than finding pleasure in cooking the food we eat, there are many other benefits to cooking mindfully. Here are a few:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Learning to listen to your body: When we take the time to think about what we are going to cook, we break our habits and create something more in tune with what our body wants and needs.</li> 
    <li>Developing your creativity: Cooking means creating! And by cooking mindfully we become open to experimenting with new flavors and new food combinations.</li> 
    <li>Making your loved ones happy! You may find cooking for others more exciting than just cooking for yourself. Cooking mindfully and then sharing your creations makes you want to immerse yourself in the experience in order to please your loved ones!&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

   <h2 id=""h-making-cooking-a-mindful-experience""><strong>Making cooking a mindful experience</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><br>So, it‚Äôs time to cook! I suggest that you try to make cooking a time of experimentation and discovery. There‚Äôs no need to prepare really elaborate meals! Simply cooking while being present will change the whole experience.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, not every day will necessarily lend itself to experimenting, so pick a day when you have time and you .</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To enjoy the experience even more, why not meditate a bit just before cooking? It doesn‚Äôt need to be a long session, a three-minute pause will do. If you use Meditopia, make sure to pick a meditation that matches your current mood.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, it‚Äôs time to head to the kitchen. First, choose the ingredients that you need. Take them in your hands, one by one, while paying attention to the way each of them feels. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a vegetable or a box: be conscious of the texture that you feel in your hands. Bring all the fragrant ingredients up to your nose, and take time to capture the different aromas and soak them in.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Set all the ingredients down in front of you. Choose each utensil carefully, ensuring to deactivate. If an ingredient needs to be cut, do it slowly, while really observing the blade do its job. If you need to mix some ingredients together, do it with curiosity: watch how the different textures intertwine with each other, how new colors appear. Allow yourself to be absorbed by each of your movements.&nbsp;</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each time you find your mind being pulled away from what you are doing, stop. Take a deep breath in and exhale, then go back to cooking. Don‚Äôt hesitate to play with the textures: take a handful of rice and let the grains fall between your fingers, feel the softness of the tomato skin against the back of your hand‚Ä¶ Test the flavors: taste your food while you‚Äôre cooking and add ingredients that would make sense: a new spice or a little bit more oil maybe? Go with your gut and trust yourself.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Finally, if your dish needs to be cooked, continue the experience by observing the bubbles that form in the pan, and notice the smells that rise up from it‚Ä¶ Try to stay mindful and present during the whole experience.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once it‚Äôs ready, it‚Äôs time to eat! Take the time to really savor the dish you have prepared with all your love, at least for the first bite.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">See, it‚Äôs easy to turn a daily task into a moment of sensory discovery, of joy and relaxation! Do you feel like trying? Have you ever practiced cooking mindfully? If you have, let us know what you thought of it in the comments!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Some sounds have the ability to raise our vibrations, and even to ease symptoms of anxiety and stress. Sound healing has been practiced across the globe and is an  that relies on various instruments to create vibrational states, taking us to unknown territories. In Aboriginal culture, sound healing has been practiced for over 40,000 years, but it also has ancient roots in other parts of the world, too. Using Tibetan bowls or gongs tuned to a specific frequency can ease the symptoms of several conditions. Some instruments are believed to have impressive healing powers, such as singing bowls, harp, pan flute, and drums. As with many mindfulness practices like yoga and meditation, sound healing is very popular these days, as our daily lives become busy and stressful.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">According to the belief in chakras, each chakra has its own frequency, meaning it‚Äôs possible to work on each chakra and balance them using specific music or sounds. Each vibration makes our chakra more rooted and helps us rebalance our energies. Chakras are defined as  centers from which the energy moves. It is believed that when our chakras are balanced, we feel in harmony and in peace. Healing music can be used to help us rebalance our chakras. There are  of vibration which determine a sound: the amplitude, which is the size of the vibration and determines how loud a sound is, and the frequency, which is the speed of the vibration and is measured in Hertz (Hz). Each chakra is associated with a specific frequency, and by visualizing the color of the chakra ‚Äî and listening to sounds scaled to that specific frequency of the chakra ‚Äî we can rebalance our emotions.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In addition, , which imply two auditory illusions of the same frequency, can have an impact on our mental wellbeing and regulate our mood. This form of  has gained popularity over the past few years and can help relieve anxiety. Binaural beats playing at a specific frequency can have specific effects; for example, delta patterns which range from 0.5‚Äì4 Hz can improve sleep and reduce insomnia, while Theta pattern ranging from 4 to 7 Hz can boost creativity and concentration. Alpha patterns from 7‚Äì13 Hz can help you to relax while Beta patterns from 13‚Äì30 Hz may improve alertness and reduce anxiety. Gemma patterns of 30‚Äì50 Hz can maintain arousal and ease some symptoms of depression.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now that we know how sound vibrations work on our mind and body, we may want to indulge in states of deep relaxation. Yet, during these uncertain times, it‚Äôs difficult to attend sound healing sessions such as a gong bath or Tibetan bowls. Yet, we do have access to a great deal of ambient healing music that can be listened to to relax ‚Äî and to find balance within ourselves. As we let the music take over our mind and soul, our body relaxes and our mind stops wandering. Meditating to music is one of the best ways to discover our inner ability to survive and glow, from the inside out.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To practice, first find a comfortable, silent place, sit comfortably on the floor and play some background music to relax. When you close our eyes, you can envision a forest, a mountain, the sea, or the ocean, and feel the vibrations of the sound slowly entering your ears. Once you enter a state of deep relaxation, you can continue the beautiful journey by visualizing something positive, warm, and enchanting, such as a poetic landscape. Take a deep breath in and out, and repeat it as you listen to the music you love.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another technique consists of listening to some music meditation podcasts. You can set up an intention before the practice, for instance, ‚ÄúToday, I want to feel love,‚Äù and let the vibrations of the sound guide you through the time you have set for yourself. Listening to background music including sounds of nature, binaural beats, or ambient music makes you feel grounded, more energetic, and relaxed. As you listen to the beauty of the sounds, you may notice a tingling sensation, a normal physical reaction, and may feel the anxiety or stress gradually leaving our body. Your mind may feel lighter and your soul more joyful, thanks to the combined power of meditation and healing music.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To get started, feel free to listen to this ambient background music by Meditopia and to indulge in its beautiful sounds.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> is best described as a state rather than a single type of activity. So, instead of picturing meditation as sitting in a cross legged position or listening to the peaceful sounds of the ocean, why not think about meditation in a broader sense? Meditation is closely related to our nervous system. Unless we switch on our calming, restful mode, it is impossible to find our way out of the jungle of our thoughts. However, there are many ways to switch this on: we can stay grounded in the present moment by following our breath, or we can use our specific senses and feelings to connect with the ‚Äúnow‚Äù. Some activities and sports are especially beneficial in helping us be more present and mindful.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever tried scuba diving? If the answer is yes, you may have already experienced the out-of-this-world feeling of being underwater. Many people find scuba diving mesmerizing, though it can be a little scary for others. One thing we know is that being underwater and in close touch with your breath is a form of meditation. Other aspects of diving help make it uniquely meditative and beneficial in many ways. Let‚Äôs check them out.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-scuba-diving""><strong>Scuba Diving</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The first and the most important step of scuba diving is staying focused on your breathing, every single second. Even though you don‚Äôt need a special breathing technique or skill, it is crucial to keep your attention on your breath. At the same time, you have to remain calm and careful because you need to use your hands for other tasks, or communicate with others. By bringing your attention to your unusual breathing you shift from your usual mode of being on auto-pilot. This shift has a profound effect on your biological system. Usually, instead of being aware of our body and our energy, we get lost in a sea of thoughts, which disconnect us from the reality of the current moment. We wander through an endless cloud of possibilities, fears, and anxieties about acceptance and survival. This puts our nervous systems in constant alert mode, which blocks our immune system and doesn‚Äôt promote physiological healing or personal progress and growth. Only when we switch this alarm off are we truly able to be aware that everything‚Äôs fine, that there is no threat to our survival, and it is possible to let go. Being immersed in water, listening deeply to our own breaths, paying special attention to how we move, and not rushing anything, is clearly a form of meditation.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Moreover, wearing a wetsuit creates an unusual sensation. It is almost like losing the sense of touch over your entire body. Add to that the loss of verbal communication and the sense of weightlessness and everything becomes quite unfamiliar and extraordinary. It is almost like a sensory deprivation tank. So we are free to be curious and simply observe, which is the core of mindfulness practices. Put in other words, diving can provide the ideal environment and conditions for meditation. Being surrounded by a beautiful, huge aquarium-like scene is another important part of the diving experience. Seeing underwater life up close with our own eyes and hearing the sound of water accompanied by our own breath, we naturally feel at one with our environment. This sounds more exciting than trying to free yourself from your thoughts while sitting in the middle of your living room, right?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Running may not be as extraordinary an experience as diving, but it is another physical activity that can support mindfulness. There is a strong emphasis on breathing while running as well. And regular breaths help our mind become clearer and more at peace. Plus, focusing on your environment, steps and rhythm can make you feel more fully present. When you run, you need to watch where you are going and where you put your feet. So, instead of thinking about your next meeting and what you will eat after your run, try to focus on the experience at hand, and thereby transform it into a form of meditation! For example, here are some things you can try to focus on. How do you transfer your weight to the ground at each step? What are your hands doing? What do you see around you? You might even notice new details about your daily route: the name of a store, the color of an object, a neighbor that has the same routine as you. Now, sprinting or high intensity running might be a bit hard to call ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù since you have to be completely focused on this powerful exercise. Regardless, this kind of physical activity  and improve the resilience of our nervous system, which also helps our meditation practice. Even during the most intense activity, it is always possible to remain mindful of the details in the moment. And when you are running or jogging, those details are everywhere!</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-swimming""><strong>Swimming</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can think of swimming as a combination of scuba diving and running. Regardless of whether you are swimming in the sea or in a pool, swimming provides similar sensations as diving. Immersed in water, the soothing feeling of weightlessness spreads throughout our whole body.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-parasailing-or-paragliding""><strong>Parasailing or paragliding</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If floating through the air sounds fun, then parachuting may be the perfect meditation for you! Parasailing is basically flying at a low altitude over the sea while being pulled by a boat. While your body has the experience of being at an unusual height and pressure, you can enjoy the view of the sea. Personally, I like being in high places and looking down at the world, but this may not be the case for everyone. I love watching people from above, and seeing all the buildings below. It reminds me of how small we are but also how connected and massive we are at the same time. If you feel the same way, focus on the wind on your skin, enjoy the bird‚Äôs eye view of the scenery, and let yourself enjoy feeling like a cloud. Paragliding may sound extreme or even terrifying to some. It may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but if you don‚Äôt have a problem with heights it is actually a very steadying and peaceful experience. It‚Äôs not like skydiving or bungee jumping. After the first kick, you just float through the air and soar like an eagle. If you‚Äôre not a professional, you are always accompanied by one. It‚Äôs like your brain gets a fun surprise because you are not supposed to be up there! So, curiously, you are 100% present in the moment. The experience can be spiritual or exciting depending on your perspective, but one thing is for sure: the extraordinary environment, high up in the sky, creates an extremely meditative experience. In addition to the adrenaline rush, this is another reason why so many people get addicted to these kinds of sports!</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-dancing""><strong>Dancing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you like dancing, you already know why it is a beautiful way to meditate. You don‚Äôt need any choreography, just let your body take control and go with the flow of the music (or not). Movement adds a unique element to meditation. When we are stressed, our body operates in sympathetic mode, as I mentioned earlier. This isn‚Äôt just in the case of major trauma. Even mild and unconscious changes that disturb us can trigger our nerves and put us on edge. This sympathetic mode sends all the blood to our muscles to prepare us for fight or flight. This results in tense shoulders, tightened abs, faster breaths, and so on. When your muscles are tense, you must be stressed too. If your muscles are clenched, it is almost impossible to get in the right mode to meditate. You must release this physical tension first. So, if you feel like nothing is working when you start a mindfulness practice, try moving around a little and only then sit down to meditate. Or, don‚Äôt sit down at all, and meditate by shaking it all off!&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Using your hands and being creative can be highly meditative. Multiple sensory signals are engaged while painting, knitting or sewing. You don‚Äôt have to be producing something ‚Äúuseful‚Äù or ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù. Just buy a coloring book and see how you lose track of time between the pages. Focusing on something regular and repetitive like the movement of a coloured pen or brush or knitting serves the same purpose as breath work. When you repeat something for long enough your brain enters a meditative state and can easily stay there for a while. Receiving tactile information is another plus. If you enjoy a handcraft that suits you, you might consider giving it a try. Don‚Äôt worry about the end result and just enjoy the ride.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It may seem hard to believe, but this really works. You might find cleaning boring, or gardening a bit dirty, but they can actually be surprisingly meditative. For some people, washing dishes, vacuuming the house or dusting are escapist activities. But instead of pushing your thoughts away, you can create space for them by doing ‚Äúhousework-as-meditation‚Äù. Don‚Äôt get obsessed with cleaning or go crazy wiping the floor, but you can try allocating one hour for doing a certain task on the weekend and spend that time in total silence, for example. Making the intention to stay connected to your stream of thoughts and not getting carried away by certain feelings can help. You can tell the other people in the house that you plan to be silent, and maybe listen to classical music on your headphones. Just be careful not to start planning the next step or thinking about the next week.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Housework-as-meditation can also include watering your plants or changing their soil. Just like handcrafts, using your hands and being in physical contact with living things is very meditative. Caring for another life also feeds us and reminds us of the unity of being. Spending mindful time giving compassionate care to something other than yourself touches the gentle parts within you. Cultivating gentle and soft feelings for others also cultivates our  and self-regulation.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Saying that 2020 has been tough feels like an understatement. Unfortunately, the ride isn‚Äôt over for many of us, and as we continue to navigate the world without much certainty about what our lives will look like in the immediate future, it is only natural to seek guidance and a sense of reassurance. During these turbulent times, the message we are getting is often more focused on protecting ourselves through strict external measures, and less about how to strengthen ourselves from within.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For instance, each of us has the capacity to strengthen our immune system through consistent and . This does not stop the spread of viruses, but it may make us more resilient to them.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-feeling-stressed-and-anxious-during-difficult-times""><strong>Feeling stressed and anxious during difficult times</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most important things to keep in mind is that being in a state of constant fear and anxiety affects your daily mood, and at a physiological level, puts a strain on your body.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When you experience strong emotions such as fear and anxiety, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) contributes to the activation of what is known as the ‚Äòfight or flight‚Äô mode. In scientific terms, this means that the body shifts its energy resources toward <em>fighting off</em> a situation that we perceive as a threat, or <em>fleeing</em> to ensure survival. The SNS signals the adrenal glands to release certain hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol to prepare the body to respond to danger. These changes include taking blood supply away from areas of the body where it is not needed, an increase in the heart and breathing rates, changes in the digestive process and an increase of glucose levels in the bloodstream.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This defense mechanism is so primitive that it doesn‚Äôt distinguish a real threat from a perceived one. So minor, everyday stressors can unnecessarily activate  and set in motion a chain reaction of unpleasant physical symptoms such as panic attacks, palpitations, muscle tension, shortness of breath, headaches, insomnia and even fear of dying.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-be-careful-about-the-information-you-consume""><strong>Be careful about the information you consume</strong></h2>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stress and fear play an important role in preserving our species; they only become a problem when our SNS is continuously activated due to constant exposure to these factors. And yet it seems that fear is the number one emotion being transmitted to us daily via our screens. In these unusual times, the non-stop flow of information‚Äìespecially news that may come across as unclear, exaggerated or designed to instill panic‚Äìkeeps us in a state of red alert, making our minds turbulent.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is OK to stay up to date with well-rounded information regarding our safety, but fear should be switched off when it no longer serves a purpose. This is when the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) will respond by turning off the stress or fear reaction and help us return to a state of balance and peacefulness.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-tips-for-boosting-your-immune-system-and-finding-peace-of-mind""><strong>Tips for boosting your immune system and finding peace of mind</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To break the vicious cycle of fear and learn ways to manage it, it is essential that we start cutting down or getting rid of the sources that cause it, and instead calm our minds. As you go about your life, pay close attention to how you feel during and after being exposed to a piece of news for example. Do you feel more calm, inspired, confident, wise, energetic or clear? Or do you feel more tired, confused, restless, emotional, sluggish, anxious or depressed?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If the latter is true, remember that there are ways to calm your mind. A peaceful mind has space for dreams, creativity, clear plans and balanced opinions.  to help you to stay grounded. Meditation is healing for people. Plus, periods of silence obtained from meditation help us develop insight and wisdom and foster a deeper connection to our own intuition, something that cannot be outsourced. Guided meditations, , and  are all great ways to switch off the fear button. If you find that doing these on your own is challenging, we are here for you, to guide you at every step of the way with  designed to help you find balance and inner peace, particularly in these uncertain times.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-look-after-your-gut-health""><strong>Look after your gut health</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another way to boost our immune system is by properly looking after our gut health. Gut flora refers to the world of microorganisms that populate our intestines. Our gut flora plays an important role not only in our metabolism but also in immune system protection. Experts in the field tell us that favorable bacteria  for the lining of our large intestines to fight against disease-causing bacteria or other substances.</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Experts therefore conclude that poor gut health leaves us vulnerable to disease. So, what harms gut flora and what keeps it healthy? The most obvious answer is our eating choices. The most harmful foods to our gut flora are those that are fried, processed, refined, containing antibiotics, preservatives, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers and artificial sweeteners. So it is not surprising that well-rounded, wholesome, high quality and ideally organic nutrition is best. It is also important to emphasize that besides consuming food with low nutritional value, other factors such as stress, lack of moderate physical activity, poor sleep quality, acid reflux drugs and antibiotics diminish gut health.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Speaking of moderate physical activity and , let‚Äôs remember that they both help us to lead healthier and happier lives: they reduce our risk of stress and depression, boost our energy levels as well as our self-esteem and mood, and, in the case of physical activity, can reduce the risk of developing certain health conditions such as heart disease.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-hygiene-hygiene-hygiene""><strong>Hygiene, hygiene, hygiene‚Ä¶</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A less discussed topic to keep our immune system strong is the practice of good ol‚Äô basic hygiene. As in: wash your hands with natural soap and water when necessary ‚Äî but there‚Äôs no need to be paranoid either. As we all have observed, the use of hand sanitizer has grown exponentially in the past few months, and although it is very easy and functional, it should be used only sparingly and not as a substitute for handwashing.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Two aspects of hand sanitizers that are usually overlooked are 1)  is a common active ingredient in hand sanitizer (and other hygiene products) and may contribute to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics (which is rather problematic) and 2) the constant use of hand sanitizer can affect the body‚Äôs microbiomes: while they kill potentially dangerous microbes, they also alter the communities of beneficial bacteria on the skin. In simple words, hand sanitizer doesn‚Äôt discriminate good microbes from bad ones so it will most likely kill good bacteria that helps the body fight diseases, which will result in lower resistance to diseases and infections. So, if you‚Äôre concerned about what your hands touch, whenever possible say ‚Äòno‚Äô to hand sanitizer and instead wash your hands with water and a bar of natural soap.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-take-advantage-of-natural-vitamin-d""><strong>Take advantage of natural vitamin D</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, let‚Äôs move on to the soothing effects of nature. We know that spending time outdoors in the natural world and soaking up some natural vitamin D from the sun (while taking the right precautions of course) is a source of positive energy and peace. But here‚Äôs an interesting fact: we have special cells in our immune system called T cells that help fight against invading pathogens. Although the , it suggests that these cells, which are abundant in the skin, may be energized by sunlight. The senior investigator of one , Gerard Ahern, PhD, associate professor in the Georgetown‚Äôs Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, says: ‚ÄúT cells, whether they are helper or killer, need to move to do their work, which is to get to the site of an infection and orchestrate a response. This study shows that sunlight directly activates key immune cells by increasing their movement.‚Äù&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">may also bring other benefits: breathing in phytoncides. Phytoncides are airborne anti-microbial substances that trees release as a way to fight off disease and harmful substances.  have shown that breathing in phytoncides while walking in a forest has beneficial effects on human Natural Killer (NK) blood cells that help fight virus-infected cells, a tangible immune system boost that can last for up to 30 days. Whenever possible, do go outside and let nature and the sun ground you, energize you, recharge your batteries, elevate your vibrations and help you put aside your worries‚Äìeven if only for a few minutes a day.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-social-support-one-of-the-greatest-tools-for-feeling-safe""><strong>Social support, one of the greatest tools for feeling safe&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Last but not least, connect with those close to your heart. Stay connected in a way that feels safe for you. People who feel socially supported are less susceptible to a range of physical and mental problems; this includes but is not limited to , better information processing, plus less anxiety and panic attacks.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all know how comforting it feels to be in the company of the people we care about, people who lift our spirits. We also know that feeling supported by a social network can help ease pain and the physical symptoms of stress. Reach out to this social network in any way or form that feels safe for you. Remember that <em>physical</em> isolation does not have to mean social isolation. Today, there are various resources and ways to connect with loved ones, even if it is physically not possible. This is not a time to be practicing social isolation, you may practice physical distancing, but, even if sometimes you do not feel like it, try to be social. Have a video call or try an online game for a change to lift your mood.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To sum up, remember that there are different ways, <em>natural ways,</em> to support our own health and immune systems. It all starts with looking after our minds. We can initiate this process immediately with simple but firm choices: make consistent efforts to eat nutritious food, get quality sleep every night, include regular and moderate physical activity in our routine, follow basic hygiene, spend time outdoors in nature, , and very importantly‚Äìas the British say, ‚ÄúKeep calm and carry on.‚Äù</p>

What is Self-Compassion and Why Do We Need It? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>In some situations, we can be unconsciously critical and harsh with ourselves. We fill up with negative comments, accusations and judgments. Self-compassion is a great tool and inner resource we have to transform and refine this attitude. We all need self-compassion. Some of us are harsher on ourselves than others, but almost everyone experiences some version of this daily. It is possible to soften this unpleasant attitude towards ourselves through self-compassion practices. So when exactly do we need self-compassion? And how does self-compassion relate to mindfulness?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-does-self-compassion-relate-to-mindfulness""><strong>How does self-compassion relate to mindfulness?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Some people tend to be harsher on themselves than others. There can be many reasons for this. In general, these feelings are triggered by social rules, common beliefs and our ideal human image. We try to mold ourselves into certain forms because we believe them to be ‚Äúright‚Äù or have been taught that they are, and when we fail to do so, our reaction can be harsh and negative. Similarly, not being able to draw  can cause us ultimately to form a destructive relationship with ourselves. If you don‚Äôt set healthy personal boundaries, you can start giving to others without factoring in your own needs, prioritizing others‚Äô expectations, and listening to your mind rather than to what your body is trying to tell you. When these healthy limits are violated, our body starts sending us signals. There are many tools we can use to notice the effects of this attitude on ourselves. These include being aware of our behavior in our relationships, receiving psychotherapy or doing group therapy. I think we all need self-compassion‚Äìor, will need at least someday‚Äìespecially as we move forward with the practice of mindfulness. Why? Here are some reasons ‚Ä¶</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-should-you-show-compassion-towards-yourself""><strong>Why should you show compassion towards yourself?</strong></h2> 
   <p>To better understand the practice of meditation, it is crucial to look closely at the nature of the mind. Think of your mind as a factory tasked with producing unlimited thoughts. Our minds can come up with all kinds of thoughts and judgments if we do not make conscious choices. Imagine that there is a decision that you need to make about the future. Your mind starts to generate thoughts and possibilities. A wide range of options, feelings, people and conversations spin around in your head. Most of these thoughts are flawed; that is, they do not reflect reality. In addition, another task of this factory is to keep us alert and prepared against possible dangers. In order to perform this task, the mind comes up with a wide range of negative and unlikely scenarios. Therefore, we either rehash the past over and over again or create new scenarios about what to do differently in the future. We assign roles to characters and make assumptions about their underlying motives for their current or future actions, because that‚Äôs how our minds work. When this happens, we can interrupt the flow of our thoughts by noticing how our mind is interfering, and start to keep a distance from our thought process. As a result, we will be able to see the products of our minds as if they were revealed to us, rather than getting lost in infinite possibilities.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-applying-self-compassion-in-daily-life""><strong>Applying self-compassion in daily life</strong></h2> 
   <p>So, what happens once you start noticing these judgments? This is when you start to use your awareness in daily life, not just when you meditate. The more you meditate, the better you get at noticing and following those judgments without getting caught up in them. As this skill develops, you begin to see and recognize the harsh thoughts that you unconsciously direct towards yourself.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>This brings us to emotions. According to cognitive psychologists, emotional states are shaped by the content of our thoughts. When you say to yourself&nbsp; ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe how careless I am! I had it coming!‚Äù, you may feel angry at or disappointed with yourself, and your body reacts to these feelings. For instance, anger can manifest as a faster heartbeat, and a chest tightness can be a sign of disappointment. Another point emphasized by cognitive psychology are the ‚Äú‚Äù that we all experience. You can think of these distortions as ‚Äúthinking errors‚Äù. We distort the actual situation by wrongly interpreting it. These distortions include being critical of both ourselves and our surroundings. One common distortion is taking a single event that happened to us and expecting the same outcome even in different contexts. After making a single mistake, we might say, ‚ÄúI always give the wrong answer anyway, I‚Äôll probably never be successful.‚Äù Meditation provides a space for you to recognize these distortions. However, it‚Äôs not enough to be aware of the harsh criticisms we project onto ourselves. We need to show ourselves self-compassion to move these distorted realities into an understanding and gentle space, and to be able to look at what is happening in an unbiased way. Otherwise, our distorted&nbsp; judgments can affect our general mood in the long run. Moreover, these judgments can turn into  when we get caught up in them, and we end up with even more reasons to feel inadequate and mistreat ourselves. Ultimately, we end up drying up the resources that we feed on and motivate us. This is also known as ‚Äòburnout‚Äô. When we are burned out, we find it very difficult to turn awareness into action. Have you ever felt totally exhausted? If someone had asked you what you really needed and exactly met your needs, how would that have made you feel? Asking yourself these very questions is the beginning of self-compassion.</p>

   </div> 
   <p>Self-compassion gives us the ability to treat ourselves with affection rather than constantly judging ourselves. This is the first element of self-compassion. Imagine that a very close friend is beating themselves up about a situation and blaming themselves. How would you treat them? You could probably look at the situation much more objectively, reminding your friend of their strengths and good sides. However, when it comes to ourselves, it is not that easy to switch to this attitude. Self-compassion makes these transitions easier. As we practice self-compassion, we begin to accept and understand feelings such as pain, failure and inadequacy, instead of getting angry at ourselves and ignoring them. Imagine someone you feel very safe with, such as a family member or your partner. Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier to show that person your vulnerable side and share your burden with them? Because when we feel embraced and safe expressing ourselves, we are better able to accept ourselves as we are. Every person has their curves and edges, ins and outs‚Äìlike the pieces of a puzzle. When we see these as they are, we begin to feel like a part of the whole as well. Instead of feeling disappointed, we can accept and let go. We need to remind ourselves that we are experiencing normal, human feelings. Focussing too much on our individual experiences makes it hard to accept things, as we see problems that need to be ‚Äúcorrected‚Äù, deficiencies that are needed to be ‚Äúfilled‚Äù, and we see our suffering as separate from that of others. This is the second element of self-compassion: choosing to see the common ground experienced by all humans rather than isolating yourself and your emotions. When we depend on other people or situations to feel compassion and feel like we are in a safe space, a part of us remains unseen and misunderstood. You are the only person who can take care of you for the rest of your life. That‚Äôs why making space for self-compassion helps everyone.</p> 
   <p>But self-compassion does not mean simply accepting every state and situation. Self-compassion is not about turning everything negative into a positive. Of course, it is natural to see the negatives, mistakes or deficiencies in ourselves or in situations. We can always choose to change or correct them, but when our distorted judgments get mixed into the situation, we lose the power within us to transform. Self-compassion helps us to use this power and capacity, neither too much nor too little, just as much as is needed. It helps us look at ourselves in a gentler way. And this brings us to the last element of self-compassion: looking at each state with awareness and authenticity.</p> 
   <p>Try to catch yourself when you criticise yourself, even if it is for very minor things. When you notice these, can you make space for all the needs and situations you feel and experience?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, especially at the beginning, we focus on our thoughts and minds. We observe the waves of our stream of ‚Äã‚Äãthought, and explore the space where our mind is more still. But where do emotions come into the equation? What is the relationship between mindfulness practices and emotions? In order to be able to answer these questions, it is necessary to look first at the relationship between your feelings and your thoughts or mind. Moreover, these are open-ended questions, and there is no clear definition of what we call ‚Äòemotions‚Äô.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-do-your-emotions-tell-you""><strong>What do your emotions tell you?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Although there is no scientific consensus, an emotion can be defined as the biological state we experience in response to our nervous and psychological state, or our thoughts and feelings. There are many theories as to the way emotions function.  emotions originate in our physiology. In other words, we first have a physical reaction, then the brain interprets this reaction as an emotion. For example, when we come face-to-face with a thief, our body starts to tremble and this generates an emotion; we think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm shaking, therefore I‚Äôm scared‚Äù.  these responses occur simultaneously. According to evolutionary theory, emotions exist to direct us to activities that will enhance us:&nbsp; we experience sadness, shame, or love in order to enhance our chances of survival by socializing, mating, and forming strong bonds. Although the working mechanism of emotions has not been fully explained, these theories provide us with a great deal of information about how we experience emotion. According to new findings, information from the environment first arrives at our emotional center and a message is transmitted from there to the higher and more developed region of the brain where thoughts are generated. Neuroscientist Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor explains this phenomenon in these words: ‚ÄúWe are actually feeling creatures who think.‚Äù In other words, we are not ‚Äúthinking creatures‚Äù in essence. In light of this information, we can speak of the existence of certain elements in the formation of our emotions: for example, our nervous system, thoughts and physiological reactions. But what does all this have to do with meditation?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-effects-of-emotions-on-the-mind-and-body""><strong>The effects of emotions on the mind and body</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our primary intention in mindfulness practices is to be fully present in the moment. The mind constantly produces thoughts about the past or the future. In addition, it makes judgments and comments on situations. All this prevents us from seeing the present situation as it actually is, and creates a veil between us and reality. The negative and vigilant state that we experience when we are swept up in our chain of thoughts, judgments and interpretations that make up this veil is called ‚Äúrumination‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are some striking conclusions regarding the relationship between emotions and rumination. , when we experience an emotion, the time that passes between the release of the relevant chemicals in our body and the reuptake of those chemicals is about 90 seconds. However, as we generate thoughts and comments about our current situation, we trigger this chain over and over again. Thus, messages continue to be transmitted from our minds to bodies, bodies to minds, and we remain in that emotion for a very long period. So, do happiness, sadness, joy and grief go through similar cycles?&nbsp; As you may have guessed, the answer is no! You may have noticed that this cycle is more valid when you are experiencing emotions such as pain and mourning, rather than moments of happiness which you might wish would never end. The reasons behind this can be found conducted with a group of university students. In it, the intensity and duration of 27 different emotions was investigated. While many emotions last for less than an hour or a few hours at most, sadness lasts the longest by far‚Äìup to five days. Although long-lasting emotions are likely to be associated with more important events, rumination is considered to be the greatest factor for this duration because our minds are tasked with warning us against dangers, and are therefore more focussed on negative states. Therefore, when a feeling surfaces as a sensation or a physical reaction, the mind can continue to nurture it and fan the flame.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another option is to suppress or ignore the emotion as a defense mechanism. If you find yourself in a chain of thought that recurs in different situations, there is probably a suppressed emotion behind this. These emotions are associated with the more primitive region of our brains which is active in our earlier years of life. Our emotions that are waiting to be seen are like small children waiting to be approached with understanding and affection. If you hug them, see and share their emotions, they will relax and move on with their life. But if you keep ignoring the emotion, it will soon make a scene and never leave you in peace. We can think of these repetitive cycles of thought as our mind‚Äôs effort to insist on showing and telling us something.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In both cases, it is not possible to see the emotion as it actually is. We usually do not experience an emotion, but rather a distorted reality. As we progress in our journey of meditation, we begin to explore the nature of our mind and how it works, from within. The ability to step back from this rumination lies at the heart of mindfulness. As our practice of meditation deepens, we gain the ability to step back from our chain of thought and take an external look at our thoughts and interpretations of the present moment. This, in turn, begins to change the way we relate to our emotions. Fortunately, the structure of the mind can easily be reshaped by regular practice, and we have the ability to witness our emotions as they actually are without getting lost in our judgments!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our knowledge of meditation dates back to ancient times, and tells us that in order to reach a state of pure consciousness it is necessary to peel off, layer by layer, everything that we call ‚Äúme‚Äù. Everything that we define as ourselves and that builds our ego by isolating us as a person from the unity of the whole‚Ä¶ First comes our name, our attributions, and status. Then come the thoughts that we carry like a part of us. Therefore, our first intention is to notice our mind and thoughts. As you begin to notice thoughts and judgments and let them go, one layer of thought slips away and falls apart. When we peel off this layer, we find the emotions of the ‚Äúme‚Äù below it. Have you ever felt like you have come to this point in your meditation practice? This experience is different for all of us. Some of us may experience violent feelings such as anger, sadness, and mourning, depending on the issues that we are currently dealing with. Some of us may feel excited or full of love, and these may surface again and again during meditation. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes, the space that meditation provides us can bring feelings such as peace and pleasure. Here, just as we do with thoughts, the main thing is to observe them passing and allow them to flow. Meditation is about allowing. Whichever type of meditation you practice, when you notice your emotions, your primary intention should be to stay in the present moment and observing them. What does this feeling look like? Does it have a color, shape, texture? Imagining these emotions, identifying where they correspond to in our body (if anywhere) and experiencing them as a physical sensation can take us to a deeper layer of awareness. Whatever the feeling, let it flow over you like a streaming river. Without getting caught up in the emotion, watch it as an observer: what is happening in you right now? Is it a physical reaction? Let it come out. When there is a desire to cry, smile, laugh, or shout, you can let all of that appear. If you shed tears, allow yourself to stay in the experience of crying. For example, laugh as much as you need to laugh, and then can continue your practice with the intention not to comment on it.</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, here is a fine line to consider. Sometimes emotions and the corresponding bodily reactions are so extreme that it can be challenging to let them go when we turn down our critical inner voice or are alone with ourselves. If we are practicing silent and motionless meditations when this happens, the effort to maintain this may be difficult and even unnecessary. Experiencing intense emotions means that your nervous system is alert and, in many cases, is caused by the loss of a sense of safety. Even when we experience what we commonly call ‚Äòpositive‚Äô emotions, our body can release more adrenaline than normal. If these systems do not settle down and we cannot send a signal to our brains that we are safe, it can be difficult to experience these emotions. Instead, you may turn to activities that help you to healthily drain away the intensity of emotions, for a while. These can be sports or physical movement, or hobbies such as arts and crafts. You can also try other ways to calm your nervous system down, such as swinging, engaging in outdoor sports, or being in contact with water. Another alternative is to try meditations whose focus is solely to express emotions. Examples of these include dynamic meditation, kundalini meditation, or dancing with body awareness to .</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Could it be that accepting and letting go is essential in the relationship between your emotions and meditation?<strong> </strong>Not resisting what is coming, letting yourself go with the flow, and seeing what awaits to be seen helps all your feelings float like a feather. When you allow yourself to go with this gentle flow, it is possible to experience emotions in their exact place and moment, as they actually are. I hope you can look at your emotions without judgment and let them flow over you in your next meditation practice! Have you had any experiences with the emotions you experienced during your meditation practice? How did it feel to experience these and what did you gain from it?

Your Emotions during the Transition from Summer to Autumn üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>As we bid farewell to summer, autumn has started to show its face with cooler weather. The season is changing, nature is changing, we are changing; even the leaves on the trees are changing. Maybe the leaves around you have started to turn yellow, while some remain green. Each creature in nature dances to its own beat and has its unique rhythm. In fact, not only nature has been changing; many things have started to change‚Ä¶even what we wear! You may also be affected by seasonal changes. Now that the weather is cooler when you go out, you may decide to take a jacket with you. Or maybe you don‚Äôt get cold that easily so you don‚Äôt need one yet. As you say goodbye to summer 2020, you may not feel ready for autumn just yet. Who knows, maybe you feel a bit chilly but you still want to take one last stroll in your summer clothes; perhaps a part of you is having a hard time saying goodbye to summer while another is well aware of the cold. In fact, each of us is feeling something different, as we are all unique. Sometimes your own feelings might waver: you might feel cold but still be unwilling to wear a jacket. Perhaps one side of you finds it easier to adapt to change, while another has difficulty keeping up with it. We all have different sides: anxious, sad, happy, brave‚Ä¶ Sometimes we adapt quickly and sometimes we have a hard time doing so‚Ä¶ Is there a side of you that is having difficulty adjusting?</p> 
   <p>These days, you may notice that your slow-to-adapt side is more prominent. Maybe you had already been struggling for a long time, and now this feeling has grown stronger. Having difficulty accepting change can lead to occasional feelings of fear, anxiety, sadness or anger. How much space can you create in your life for these feelings?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-challenges""><strong>Challenges</strong></h2> 
   <p>This year, the transition from summer to autumn has a different meaning for all of us. Since the beginning of 2020, all of humanity has been going through an ambiguous and difficult time. We have been‚Äìand still are‚Äìexperiencing many changes. Do you remember how many uncertainties there were at the beginning of the ? We were faced with a virus we were not familiar with and it affected the way we relate to our entire lives. Our routines, family life, school life, activities, travel‚Äìthey all changed. We had to wear masks all the time outside the house. We tried to follow the measures we were told to. While some were easy to follow, some required more time and effort. We tried not to get sick. We tried to protect our loved ones. Still, some of us got sick. We all experienced loss, some different and some similar to each other. We acquired new habits. We said goodbye to some old ones. We all have a long list of things that have affected our lives in this period. While some things are behind us, the effort it took to adapt and change caused us to become exhausted both physically and mentally. It was not always possible to give ourselves the time and care we deserved during each transition. Perhaps being aware of these hardships made it difficult for us to continue with our lives.</p> 
   <p>Now, let‚Äôs get back to summer. How was your summer? Did you take a break, or were you able to keep up with the new normal without one? Some of us were able to adapt to the new normal this summer, even if just a little bit, and some were not. Following measures has become normal for us; our knowledge about the virus has increased and our elbow room has grown. Plus, sunny days gave us more freedom. We were able to meet our loved ones face to face. We felt safer outdoors. All this made us forget about the pandemic to some degree. We felt a bit less restricted during the summer, and a bit more relaxed and confident. Did you also feel a little more comfortable and safe during the summer? Or maybe your circumstances weren‚Äôt that conducive, and you couldn‚Äôt have a break this summer.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-emotions""><strong>Emotions</strong></h2> 
   <p> might trigger a resistance to change that may have existed within you even prior to the pandemic. Still, for many of us, leaving summer 2020 behind might feel even more different and difficult than in the past. What feelings have you experienced with the end of summer? Did the cooler weather trigger feelings of worry and fear?</p> 
   <p>You may feel afraid, anxious, sad or angry more often these days. Remind yourself that all these feelings are actually quite natural and common. You might be anxious about the possibility of going back to greater restrictions and uncertainties due to the pandemic. Maybe you don‚Äôt feel this way, but you have a sense of unease that you can‚Äôt immediately identify. Not being able to understand or notice your feelings can make you feel nervous as it amplifies your worries and fears. So, how can you deal with all this uncertainty?</p> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">

   </div> 
   <p>Worries and fears can be intimidating. These emotions have only been amplified by the pandemic. We are surrounded by them. Consciously or unconsciously, we try to suppress or escape these emotions instead of allowing ourselves to experience them. However, trying to avoid these emotions does not mean we can get rid of them. Not allowing yourself to experience these emotions can manifest itself in many different ways, such as pain in a part of your body, nightmares, bingeing, skipping meals or not being fully&nbsp; present in the moment. In fact, allowing yourself to feel an emotion (even if it is upsetting) and giving yourself the freedom to experience fear or anxiety is the most effective way to deal with all this. By staying in an emotion rather than trying to escape it, it will both become manageable and you will discover ways to handle it. Are you feeling any unpleasant emotions? Can you experience them with compassion and without judgment? Remember, what you are feeling is totally natural. We don‚Äôt always feel good; sometimes we do, but sometimes we face difficulties. Many of us are feeling uncomfortable about the transition to autumn and the uncertainty that comes with it.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-make-room-for-your-emotions""><strong>Make room for your emotions</strong></h2> 
   <p>So, what can you do with these emotions when you are having a hard time? How about making some room for them? Is it possible to stay in them, even if they make you feel uncomfortable? Just as we all experience the transition from summer to autumn differently, there isn‚Äôt any single way to experience difficult feelings. We are all unique, and so is the way we experience emotions. We are on our own path, full of variety. We don‚Äôt know what life will bring. Yes, this coming autumn may bring more uncertainty. It is normal to feel stressed. The main thing is to make room for your emotions, even though it will be challenging. First, start by reminding yourself that there is room for all your emotions. It can be helpful to tell yourself that your feelings are welcome, without any judgment and with compassion. Singing, dancing, exercising, meditating or engaging with art are all good ways to release your feelings. Sometimes, you might not feel like doing anything or just can‚Äôt find the strength to start something new. Sometimes, you can show yourself some compassion by brewing yourself a cup of tea or watching your favorite TV show. It‚Äôs also a good idea to remember that you can get support from a mental health professional to help you through this change. Remember, this is the first time any of us has experienced a pandemic, and this is the first autumn during it‚Ä¶</p>

You Don‚Äôt Have to Feel Good All of the Time üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>How did you feel when you woke up this morning? How about during the rest of the day? How will you feel before you go to bed? It‚Äôs impossible to give the same answer to all these questions. Sometimes, and often for no reason, we don‚Äôt feel what people expect us to feel‚Äìor, more importantly, what we expect <em>ourselves</em> to feel. How does it affect you when your feelings and expectations are not in line with each other?</p> 
   <p>Are you afraid of ‚Äòbringing people down‚Äô when you tell them that you‚Äôre not feeling great? Do you feel guilty or anxious that you might make them feel bad by sharing your feelings? Most importantly, do you think that the challenging feelings will ‚Äògo away‚Äô, and you will feel better if you just tell yourself that everything is fine?</p> 
   <p>Maybe you have these thoughts, or many more. Notice that none of these thoughts has an actual effect on your emotions. Emotions are always there. What matters is how you actually feel about a situation, not what you <em>should</em> feel about it. There is no such thing as a ‚Äòbad‚Äô feeling. If you feel something, then it is real. Trying to avoid it, being out of touch with your emotions, or thinking that you should feel good all the time just makes you suffer more, and prevents you from understanding and expressing yourself.</p> 
   <p>Letting yourself feel your emotions is just as important as any other basic need. Remember, you are not just a body; your body is whole together with your mind and emotions. Your soul may not feel well one day, just like your body may catch a flu and get sick. Do you get angry at your arm if it aches? When you have a headache, do you say to yourself: ‚ÄúWhy are you aching? No, you are not actually aching and you are just fine.‚Äù Or else do you try to understand why you have a headache and find the best way to treat it?</p> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
     <noscript>  
     </noscript> 
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <p>Just like all other living creatures, we too are dualistic beings. Remember that we feel more at peace when we find balance between these dualities. We can only achieve this peace if we embrace our difficult emotions the same way as we embrace emotions that bring us joy.</p> 
   <p>Does a part of you feel that it is ‚Äòwrong‚Äô to feel tired, mad, anxious, hurt or angry?</p> 
   <p>Sometimes we try to ignore these feelings, or label them as negative. We think that if we ignore them and shut our minds to them, they will disappear. But the opposite is true: the more we lose touch with these emotions, the more our unease grows. It is not natural to always feel good, so you can feel uneasy if you force yourself to think that you should.</p> 
   <p>Your emotions may seem like a Pandora‚Äôs Box that you‚Äôre afraid to open. So, you may try to always feel good, think positively, and not leave space for any negative feelings. Yes, you may experience challenging emotions you do not want to feel. However, don‚Äôt forget that these emotions are always there, even if you try to ignore them. Hence, you can only find relief if you try to understand and name them.</p> 
   <p>When you stop pushing your limits, and choose to accept all your emotions and states, you will realize that thinking that you have to feel good all the time is actually a burden. Don‚Äôt try to find a reason behind your negative feelings. There may not always be a reason you can understand at the moment, so just observe and notice them. You may not be all right, you may feel angry, tired, mad or exhausted. Not feeling good all the time is very natural and a part of your existence.</p> 
   <p>Not understanding your feelings can make you feel uncomfortable. While trying to cope up with this unease, you may have a tendency to sweep everything under the carpet, and tell yourself that you are fine. Don‚Äôt push yourself to try to understand why you feel uneasy: the feeling is there and belongs to you. Know that you have a right to feel bad and remind yourself of this.</p> 
   <p>Observe how much effort it takes to try to always feel good. You do not have to feel good for anybody. You can share your challenging emotions with others. For example, you don‚Äôt have to seem like you feel fine for your children, if you have them. Children want parents who can explore all their emotions and are able to express them because they are real. When you don‚Äôt feel well, if you don‚Äôt share this with the people around you (who may make you feel guilty) you will find everything even more tiring. Observe your relationship with your partner, if you have one. Your partner accepts all your states, as long as you accept and express your feelings.</p> 
   <p>Bear in mind that everybody feels off from time to time. You may not always be able to take care of yourself, and this is very human. You may think you need to immediately understand your emotions, but in fact emotions that are understood in time are more precious. Being compassionate about time, yourself and your own timing will enhance your emotional resilience. When you face difficult emotions or feel that something is missing, you can make some time for yourself to understand them. Owning all your emotions will open a door for you to better understand precious emotions and embrace them with care.</p> 
   <p>Sometimes, it is difficult to preserve the balance between challenging and joyful emotions. When you are having difficulty, you can share this with others. Perhaps you think that they will worry about you or change their opinion of you. However, remember that we all have difficult times. The only difference is that some of us experience difficult emotions more often, more intensely and more obviously. In fact, if we could all ask for support when needed, it would be easier for all of us to go through difficult times. We all need support. Don‚Äôt be afraid to show your vulnerabilities to the people you love; they can be much stronger than you think. And if you need it, seek professional support. You can check the professional services available in your city, and get professional help when you need to talk with someone or seek the advice of a professional.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You finally started to meditate! When you start something new, at first it‚Äôs easy to do it every day because you are still excited by it and in the ‚Äòhoneymoon‚Äô phase. But because we are surrounded by other new options and experiences, that feeling of excitement can quickly fade and you might be tempted to give up. However, as you know very well if you‚Äôre reading this article, the secret to making  truly effective is to . Don‚Äôt panic, here are five tips to help you make meditation part of your daily routine and a source of joy in your daily life!</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-prepare-a-nice-place-to-meditate-for-your-daily-routine""><strong>1. Prepare a nice place to meditate for your daily routine</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To make you want to meditate each day, choose a pleasant spot to meditate at home, at the office, or anywhere else. One of the many advantages of meditation is that it doesn‚Äôt require a lot of space. You can choose a small corner of a room and arrange it any way you want, perhaps adding a candle, incense, a rug and a meditation cushion, for example.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Think of this place as your refuge, a personal sanctuary into which you can bring all that you are, feel and go through each day. Just thinking about this place that you created, that belongs only to you, and where you feel perfectly at ease, can fill you with a sense of comfort.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After meditating a few times in this space, it will become part of your wellness routine. Soon, you will have only one wish when you wake up in the morning: to settle down for a few minutes of peace with yourself.</p>

   </figure> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-create-your-own-pre-meditation-ritual""><strong>2. Create your own pre-meditation ritual&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Creating a ritual that you practice before each meditation may seem unnecessary and bordering on spiritual. But rituals exist for a good reason: they prepare us and put us in the right mood to meditate.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, only you can decide what your ritual will be. But here are some examples to inspire you to create your own pre-meditation routine:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Drink some warming tea,</li> 
    <li>Stretch,</li> 
    <li>,</li> 
    <li>Light some incense,</li> 
    <li>Listen to a soothing song‚Ä¶</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can create a ritual to match your personality and needs. The important thing is that it should come naturally to you and make you feel relaxed. And it doesn‚Äôt have to take long: even a couple minutes of stretching before meditating will do the trick.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This ritual can also evolve over time, because you too will evolve as you develop your meditation practice. So don‚Äôt hesitate to adjust your ritual in line with your needs. Above all, whatever you do, listen to yourself, listen to your body and do what feels right in the moment, with kindness.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-choose-comfortable-meditation-clothes""><strong>3. Choose comfortable meditation clothes&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now that you know where you‚Äôll meditate every day and have created a ritual to help you get ready, it‚Äôs time to choose some comfortable clothes.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Again, there are no rules: this moment belongs to you only, so if you want to wear pajamas with polka dots rather than yoga pants, that‚Äôs totally up to you! Ideally, though, you should wear similar clothing each time you meditate to strengthen the ‚Äúritual‚Äù feel to your practice. Whenever you put on these clothes you will feel mentally prepared to meditate and be still for a moment.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As for me, I like to wear something that I find both pretty and comfortable, so I can feel comfy while bringing a touch of dignity to my meditative practice. So, once again, the best thing is to pick clothes that match your personality.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-4-pick-the-time-at-which-to-meditate-each-day""><strong>4. Pick the time at which to meditate each day</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Picking a set time to sit down every day to meditate can really help to , for two reasons:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>If you set the time in advance, then you know that it is in your diary and that you can‚Äôt plan anything else at that time,</li> 
    <li>Your brain loves pre-established schedules and, gradually, it will become natural to meditate at your chosen time because your mind will create a routine to which it becomes accustomed.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Think about which time of the day works best for you: in the morning when you wake up, at night before bed, at noon during your lunch break or another time that‚Äôs convenient for you. Choose how long you will meditate, add a few minutes for your pre-meditation ritual, then set an alarm to remind you to meditate each day.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </noscript> 
   </figure> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-5-choose-the-position-in-which-you-prefer-to-meditate-and-maintain-it""><strong>5. Choose the position in which you prefer to meditate, and maintain it</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here, the idea is to try to avoid reasons to delay meditating. The solution is to know where, when and how you will meditate‚Äìeven before you settle down for your session.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you like to meditate sitting down, think ahead whether you want to be in the Burmese position, in a half-lotus position or if you want to practice sitting in a full lotus position, for example. If you want to meditate sitting on a chair, have your chair ready. Of course, your position may change over time, and that‚Äôs OK. You‚Äôll also probably want to try out different positions before deciding which one works best for you. But, once you find one that you like, don‚Äôt change it for a while, so you won‚Äôt have to choose a position each time you sit down to meditate.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I hope that these 5 simple tips will help you develop a daily meditation routine that you both like and that makes you want to keep up your practice. However, remember this: meditation can be practiced anywhere and at any time.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So even though it‚Äôs a great idea to follow these tips and develop a consistent meditation routine, try not to become too attached to these new habits, and remain flexible in your practice. Because if you become too attached to the comfort of this routine, it may feel more difficult to meditate on the go, or when you find yourself in an unusual situation for one reason or another.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Never forget that it‚Äôs all about balance! So,  and if these tips helped you make meditation a part of your daily routine, or if you have any questions about your practice, please write down a comment below!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-1-choose-a-place-to-meditate""><strong>1. Choose a place to meditate</strong></h2>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This may seem like a mere technicality, but it‚Äôs actually really important. Using a timer will allow you to stop worrying about one of the most stressful aspects of daily life: what time it is, the amount of time you have left, your schedule‚Ä¶</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, and remember that the more time you meditate the better! But even a very short session is beneficial!

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For a guided meditation, choose a session in line with your needs and the amount of time you have to meditate. If you use Meditopia you can pick a meditation based on your current mood, feelings or even a subject that you find particularly interesting at the moment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-4-find-a-good-position-to-meditate""><strong>4. Find a good position to meditate</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now it‚Äôs time to get settled. Do the best you can considering your location: sit down, lie down or do a walking meditation, depending on where you are.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">. Relax your shoulders, the tension in your face ‚Äì relax your forehead, your cheeks, your nose, your jaws ‚Äì all the tense muscles in your body.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you have time, do a body scan and go through each of your body parts. Relax all your limbs one by one, starting from your feet going up towards your skull.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you have decided to follow a guided meditation you can either follow steps 5 and 6 before listening to it, or you can start listening to it and skip straight to step 7.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-5-connect-to-the-here-and-now""><strong>5. Connect to the here and now</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once you have settled and relaxed all your muscles, it‚Äôs time to be fully present.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You already started to settle into the here and now in the previous step. Now it‚Äôs time to connect with your environment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What sounds do you hear? What do you see? What do you smell? How is the temperature?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Next, connect to your inner world: How do you feel? What are your current thoughts and feelings? Take note of your current inner state without judging it, merely as a witness.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">. First, simply be aware of its rhythm and depth. Notice if you are breathing from your chest or your abdomen. Don‚Äôt change anything for now, just observe.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After a few breaths, start lengthening the time it takes you to breathe in and the time it takes for you to breathe out. You can gradually make your breaths last longer, with your exhalations lasting longer than your inhalations.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stay present with your breath throughout the meditation.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As thoughts come up, accept them and let them float by, like clouds above a grounded and solid mountain. Don‚Äôt let yourself follow your thoughts, and don‚Äôt judge them either. Be conscious of them, yet stay present in the moment.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Continue to stay focused on your breath until the end of your meditation.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once your guided or silent meditation is over, get back in touch with your environment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Open your eyes if they have been closed, and look around you slowly. Move your feet, your hands, your head. Stretch as much as you need to.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take advantage of this moment of transition to the present.  of relaxation before getting back to your activities.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I hope that this short guide to meditating anywhere will help you to enjoy meditating on business trips, vacation, at work or anywhere else!&nbsp;</p>

   <p>Pandemics spread both psychologically and physiologically. When our survival is threatened, both our psychology and our relationship with our environment can be seriously affected.</p> 
   <p>The anxiety you felt at the beginning of the pandemic could turn into fear as the intensity increases. If you have developed a phobia of the disease, you may become obsessive about preventing it, which paradoxically can lead to you being less protected. When your awareness and sense of security is damaged, it becomes difficult to judge your behavior in a rational way. For example, panic buying can be a sign that you have difficulty determining what you actually need, and are stocking up more than necessary. You become less able to accurately assess physical sensations, your health and how to protect yourself. As a result, you might start taking extreme actions. All this leads to another, different pandemic: a psychological one. When you see other people acting in a similar way, and allow your behaviour to be dictated by fear, you pass on the same message to the people around you. This leads to certain common patterns of emotion and behavior.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-our-psychological-defense-mechanisms-during-the-pandemic""><strong>Our Psychological Defense Mechanisms during the Pandemic</strong></h2> 
   <p>Since everyone is feeling the same thing, it is easier to observe the changes in each other. The danger created by the pandemic and the measures we need to take to protect ourselves are all around us. The pandemic is constantly on our minds. The psychological effect is easily visible in our obsessive focus on certain behaviors and frequent expression of the emotions it creates. This leads us to try to control our feelings; the most common methods include denying our fear or even actively trying to forget it.</p> 
   <p>Using masks and disinfectants has become a normal part of life. Going to work, meeting people and maybe even traveling don‚Äôt seem like such huge risks anymore. Taking ordinary measures and returning to our routine can significantly reduce our fears. As people become less afraid, there is a risk that they will stop taking the necessary protective measures. Meanwhile, the number of cases&nbsp; increases every day. This second wave, which is never far away, leads people to panic yet again. So we find ourselves back at the beginning of the emotional cycle that we thought we had completed‚Ä¶</p> 
   <p>Just like anxiety and fear, denial and risky behaviour are also contagious, as is rejecting or refusing to comply with the rules needed to fight the pandemic. People are affected by their environment and, in turn, they affect their own environment. Our environment serves as a signal to follow similar patterns of behavior.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-happened-to-our-behaviors""><strong>What happened to our behaviors?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Common behavior patterns can make it difficult to identify and filter our own feelings and thoughts. When we feel insecure, we tend to adopt the same behaviours as others. It becomes almost impossible to behave differently. The more common our behaviors are, the easier it becomes to deal with our anxiety. This is one of the main factors of contagious behaviour: doing the same thing as other people creates a sense of security, whether we are engaging in protective or risky behavior.</p> 
   <p>This mass behaviour, which can be helpful in spreading protective actions, is influenced by many things, not just health and medical systems. The atmosphere to which we are exposed, our interactions with the environment, and the way the health risk is handled play a crucial role in our social reaction.</p> 
   <p>It can be hard to reach rational decisions when you are exposed to misinformation and face increased doubt and uncertainty. We have been exposed to these for a long time, throughout the pandemic. This can lead to significant changes in our psychology. We may find it difficult to assess the efficacy of the measures we take, and of our ability to cope. Individual or social factors can leave us feeling weak in the face of the pandemic, and vulnerable to the disease. And as this process goes on and on, we are more likely to engage in denial, stop believing that preventative measures actually work, long to return to past comfortable days, feel trapped and angry, and engage in risky behavior. Refusing to follow the rules is just as contagious as needing to follow them.</p> 
   <p>We find it easier to protect ourselves when we feel like we are in a safe environment, both emotionally and physically. When we feel insecure, we feel more vulnerable and our anxiety levels rise, or we can even be driven to despair. Especially when the process goes on longer than we expected, our reaction to the pandemic can change drastically over time.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-about-our-perception""><strong>How about our perception?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Our perception of hygiene changes when our health is at stake. For example, we perceive ourselves or the objects we come into contact with as dirtier. Even a simple table or chair can become terrifying.&nbsp; There is an evolutionary reason for this increase in disgust, as it is a primary instinct that protects us from poisoning and harm.</p> 
   <p>Nevertheless, there is much to gain from this difficult process. At the end of all this chaos, we will be much more united as humanity, and we will seek psychological solutions to our problems. We are learning to be aware when we get lost in conspiracy theories, and that we should look for rational answers to our questions. It is possible to sift through the information pollution, to remain realistic and to make decisions that are as little affected by panic as possible. This difficult process can teach us a lot about our psychology. This ongoing and collective problem takes us down socio-psychological paths that allow us to observe our personal reactions, and may even help us to get to know ourselves better.</p> 
   <p>In addition to protecting yourself and your loved ones, you may also wish to better understand your emotional experiences. Some of us may find it easier to explore our feelings than others. Any attempts are very valuable. Every step we take towards a more positive position is a part of spiritual healing. This state of healing and protection also helps protect our physical health. Therefore, while it isn‚Äôt always easy, taking care of and using our inner resources will protect us from the destructive effects of the chaotic period we are going through.</p> 
   <p>In moments when we feel very anxious and afraid, we can try to return to our most basic resources. Sometimes setting a simple goal will help lower your expectations. For example, just remembering to breathe, motivating ourselves to go for a walk, or taking a break from our plans are all things we can try at different times. Remember that, like everything else, this too shall pass. Enjoy the order and transformation of nature, and realise that every day opens news doors. We will come out of the pandemic with a whole host of emotions, and we can adapt to many situations during the process. We can try to keep our joy alive by remembering what is good for us, by allowing ourselves to experience them, and by remembering that, despite everything, we have the power to heal ourselves.</p>

When you open your eyes in the morning, you see your ironed school uniform in front of you. You feel nervous about the day ahead. Because today is the first day of school!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Most of us have memories like this. While going back to school was exciting, it was also a bit nerve wracking‚Ä¶ It can feel overwhelming to be away from your parents, surrounded by people you don‚Äôt know, starting new subjects you‚Äôve never heard of, learning how to read and write, and meeting new authority figures such as the school principal or your teacher‚Ä¶ In fact, though many years have passed, we as adults still experience quite similar feelings. As much as starting a new chapter can be exciting, the uncertainty and responsibility that come with it .</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Does the idea of returning to all your responsibilities seem scary after three months off? Waking up early every morning, not being able to do whatever you want whenever you want, and being mentally and physically exhausted can be overwhelming. Going back to your school routine may not sound too attractive after  and loved ones. Of course, you may not have spent the summer on vacation. Perhaps, you chose to do an internship, work, study or rest.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-shake-off-the-sluggishness-of-summer""><strong>Shake off the sluggishness of summer</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So how did you spend your summer? Even if you didn‚Äôt have much of a break, the summer months can lead to feeling a bit sluggish. Having fewer responsibilities and seeing other people also on vacation can make it hard to leave your comfort zone. Your to-do list can become longer and longer, and you might not feel motivated enough to start over. It is normal to feel unmotivated, considering you haven‚Äôt been in school for a long time. However, you won‚Äôt really be starting from scratch when you come back. Think about how hard your first workout was after taking a break from going to the gym. After just a few days, your performance will have improved immensely, with a rested body and mind. Similarly, you need to give yourself some time to transition from vacation-mode to regain your motivation.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-excitement-or-stress""><strong>Excitement or Stress?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">How often do you feel stressed about going back to school? The physiological and psychological effects of excitement and stress on our body are quite similar. Yet there are fundamental differences between them: stress aims to keep us alive in the face of potential danger, while excitement prepares us to act in anticipation of a positive event. Before making a presentation on a subject that we care about, our hearts thump, we break out in a cold sweat and our knees knock together. The hormones adrenaline and cortisol can cause our body to confuse an exciting situation with a stressful one. In light of this, do you think ? When you feel very stressed, turn to your body, listen to your breath and ask yourself what you are feeling at that moment. Without judging yourself, try to be more positive by telling yourself, ‚ÄúThe feeling I am having right now is more like excitement than stress.‚Äù</p>

When you don‚Äôt have to get up early for school or want to avoid the daytime heat, you might have gotten into the habit of sleeping late. If you wait for the day before school starts to get out of your summer night owl mode, the first days of school will not go well.

Browsing some content online will pique your interest and . Getting back to our sports metaphor, what matters is that you enjoy the process and don‚Äôt focus too much on the outcome.

   <h3 id=""h-do-you-feel-unhappy-about-online-education""><strong>Do you feel unhappy about online education?</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Unlike in previous years, you‚Äôll start the semester online. If you feel upset about this, believe me, you‚Äôre not alone. You may not be as eager to start school as you were before, since you won‚Äôt be able to hang out with friends at the school cafeteria or between classes. None of us would choose this situation. However, there are things you can do to accept the situation and still have a good semester.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take small breaks with your friends to reconnect. Log onto the video conference application you are using and have tea or coffee together, as if you were all hanging out together in front of the faculty building. Chat normally, not about school. This way, you can feel closer both to school and to your friends. Remember that . Sharing your problems will not only make you feel better but also help you to support your friends emotionally.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can also spend a few minutes a day imagining walking around your favorite spots at school using visualization techniques; this way, you will feel like you are at school even though you are in your room.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-say-goodbye-to-yesterday-before-embracing-tomorrow""><strong>Say goodbye to yesterday before embracing tomorrow</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many people feel like they have ‚Äòwasted‚Äô their summer, and regret doing ‚Äònothing‚Äô. ‚ÄúI could have read a lot more books, watched more movies, ‚Ä¶‚Äù. The list could go on for forever. What do you wish you had done more this summer?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In a world where we are forced to be more and more competitive, comparing yourself to others can be demoralising. During transition periods like New Year‚Äôs Eve, graduation or going back to school, it is very normal to evaluate where you are in life. It‚Äôs kind of like looking back on our recent past, collecting data and preparing a report in order to perform better in the future. But we are not always objective or rational. When we compare ourselves to others, we can blame ourselves for what we perceive to be our ‚Äòfailures‚Äô and their ‚Äòsuccesses‚Äô. This sense of failure can be so intense that it overshadows our accomplishments, the things we are grateful for, and the experiences we are lucky to have.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If this happens to you, try to take a step back, pause and think. Conscious awareness will help you to do this, as it provides a free and peaceful space to process. While coming to terms with your situation, it is very important to avoid judging or criticising yourself. It is very normal to feel self-critical when you‚Äôre facing a new academic year. It‚Äôs not so easy to stop thinking, ‚ÄúI wish I had done more sports, I wish I had travelled a bit more and read more, because I might not have this much free time ever again!‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Without trying to change your feelings, just observing these thoughts as they pass through your mind will help you more than you might expect. Just because a thought passes through your mind does not mean it is real; you can choose to believe it, get carried away by it, or not. It might also help to think of some good memories. Paradoxically, thinking about what you have gained from things you regret can also help you to stop judging and criticizing yourself.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Try to observe what you have or have not done without labelling them as good or bad. Can you accept the ‚Äúyou‚Äù of the past few months just as you are?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As you reflect on the past summer with awareness, you will feel more at peace. You won‚Äôt feel the need to cover up your shortcomings, feel insecure or panic. Instead, you can adopt a calm and relaxed attitude and savor every exciting moment.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">New experiences and beginnings are always exciting. Now, it‚Äôs time to focus on the specific details about this new period that excite you. This can be highly personal. Without feeling that you need to share it with others, think about what makes you happy and write it down. Just remembering and focussing on them will help you during the transition.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">September is a great time to welcome autumn. Soft rain and an evening breeze are a balm after the overwhelming summer heat, and soft gray clouds finally obscure the burning sun‚Ä¶ How about a nice cup of coffee? Autumn is the perfect time to get a warm drink, snuggle under a blanket and lose yourself in your favorite TV show or movie to unwind at the end of the day.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You may not be able to sit next to your classmates but you will at least see them more often. While you may have kept in touch with your friends over the summer, you will now see them almost every day. You can talk to them about your courses, exams and homework‚Ä¶ You can study with your friends via video, ask each other questions, and make homework much more fun.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">But sometimes your daily routine can become boring. However, how you approach your routine can make all the difference. Instead of getting stressed out by doing the same thing every day, focus on the peace and comfort that this structure brings to your life. Many studies have shown that  and waking up at the same time every day, and having your meals at a regular time help to regulate stress levels. You can better enjoy school days by creating fun routines for yourself.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You may feel more stressed than usual since your transition back to school coincides with a difficult time for the whole world. Remember that what you are feeling is completely natural and don‚Äôt be afraid to explore new ways and perspectives that might help you. Only you know what is best for you, and yet it may seem hard to convince yourself. So, based on all this, what would say to someone starting the new school year? Please share your ideas with us!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Over the past few years, we‚Äôve heard a lot about mindfulness, , and meditation. As we deal with the  and anxiety caused by our busy lives, we are all looking for new paths to freedom and inner peace ‚Äî and mindfulness is a great way to achieve this.  is the ability to be fully aware and present without becoming overwhelmed by what‚Äôs happening around us. And we all have the innate ability to do this. As a concept, mindfulness is highly linked to meditation. So, what‚Äôs the difference between mindfulness and meditation? How can we make mindfulness a part of ? Let‚Äôs find out.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-mindfulness-vs-meditation""><strong>Mindfulness vs meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As meditation, yoga, and relaxation use similar techniques, it‚Äôs not always easy to understand what mindfulness is and what it is not. Mindfulness ‚Äî or the art of  in the moment ‚Äî enables us to look inside ourselves, without judgment. As we observe and  without over-thinking, we notice the sensations and feel the power of the present moment. It‚Äôs like , accepting things for what they are.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When practiced regularly, mindfulness meditation has the power to help us accept ourselves as we truly are. Our masks fall away as we open our eyes to our soul. We learn to accept and let go of what no longer serves us ‚Äî which is where happiness resides.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-areas-where-mindfulness-can-help""><strong>Areas where mindfulness can help</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we are more mindful, we approach the world with fresh eyes, which reduces stress and anxiety. Our thoughts become clearer, more in line with our vision of life, or . Our performance and insights improve too, as we clear away the noise, wrong thinking, and beliefs that limit us. It has also been proven that practicing mindfulness can lower blood pressure, and improve memory and cognitive skills while reducing heart disease and chronic pain. As a result, almost every aspect of our lives can be profoundly altered when we embrace mindfulness techniques and slowly begin to meditate each and every day.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3><strong>Mindfulness improves the workplace</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindfulness practice helps sharpen our skills, readjust our priorities, and balance our work life. It allows us to identify and focus on what‚Äôs important ‚Äî not just what‚Äôs urgent. We slow down and forget about multi-tasking, which is draining, and we prioritize doing one thing at a time ‚Äî the true catalyst for high productivity. Mindfulness also enhances our  ‚Äî which is our capability to comprehend our own emotions, sensations, and feelings, as well as understanding more about other people‚Äôs emotions, sensations, and feelings. This leads to better relationships with our peers, colleagues, and bosses, improving connections in the.</p>

   <h3 id=""h-helping-out-with-family-issues""><strong>Helping out with family issues</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> can be draining, stressful, hectic, and full of conflict. In my case, I come from a broken home. Chaos, fights, hate, and destruction were a daily part of my family life. People from broken homes can become weak, insecure, hypersensitive, and stressed. As the years pass and we learn about mistakes ‚Äî ours and others ‚Äî we understand the true nature of our family. Mindfulness gives us tools to allow forgiveness to enter our hearts. As we forgive and forget, we grow. And forgiveness brings positive change. Acceptance and letting go of hate reveals new paths to build something new. Today, my relationship with my mum, which was full of conflict for over 20 years, has become healthy, friendly, and happy ‚Äî as I learned forgiveness thanks to mindfulness and meditation.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-improving-our-relationship-with-others""><strong>Improving our relationship with others</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As mindfulness helps us to see the truth, we no longer feel suspicious of other people. We accept them for who they are and understand that each of us sees the world in our own way. Embracing differences and cultivating open-mindedness through mindfulness enables us to build healthier relationships. Jealousy, rivalry, vanity, or betrayal can be better understood with mindfulness. As we grow, we keep those who matter to us within our circle and let go of toxic people, and, consequently, our relationships improve exponentially. We learn to without being afraid of disappointing others, and can manage stress, , and our vision of friendships without fear. Furthermore, deep meditation practices help empathy, compassion, and  enter our life.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We tend to believe that others are responsible for our happiness, joy, and inner fire. But true happiness actually lies within. It‚Äôs already there, inside you, and can be tapped into each day just by taking small steps and actions that bring positive change. Mindfulness enables us to love ourselves more ‚Äî or, in fact, better ‚Äî just as we are. We are not perfect. We are human beings. We have flaws. Of course, during the course of our lives, we need to learn, grow, and change. But we can‚Äôt force ourselves to be what we are not. Each of us has dignity, space, beauty, and limits. Mindfulness helps us capture the true beauty inside us, and lets us accept that we neither can or should aim to be perfect.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs easy to start a daily mindfulness practice. We don‚Äôt need to attend a full meditation retreat ‚Äî although immersion is highly recommended if possible ‚Äî to become more mindful. Today, start trying out simple mindfulness techniques; if you set aside 5 minutes each day, you can become more mindful. Just by reading this article, you have already started on your path towards mindfulness!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-why-should-we-use-mindfulness-in-our-daily-lives""><strong>Why should we use mindfulness in our daily lives?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Today, we hear  everywhere. Eating mindfully, doing sports mindfully, reading mindfully‚Ä¶it sounds like some passing trend that we will all soon forget about.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, this is much more than some new trend, and it goes way beyond ‚Äúcool things‚Äù to do on the weekend. Living mindfully has become a necessity. Adding mindfulness to our daily lives opens the doorway to a balanced life.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We constantly have to go faster; our obligations multiply everyday and we are always running out of time. This way of life seems normal to us now. We have come to believe that  is natural; we even think it helps us make progress in our projects and daily tasks.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Do you remember the last time you were totally relaxed while doing something? When you were not thinking about the last conversation you had, planning what you need to do next, or without trying to make a mental list of the groceries you need for tonight‚Äôs dinner? If your answer is no, don‚Äôt worry‚Äìyou are far from alone. It‚Äôs as if we have forgotten how to live in the present moment. And even if we think that we are ‚Äúused‚Äù to this state of mind, our brains are suffering immensely.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We are under constant pressure everyday, and it has become very difficult to completely release tension from our bodies. Our bodies are tense, our digestive systems are often dysregulated, our minds are overheated. But integrating mindfulness into our lives can help us deal with these issues.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs time to come back down to Earth. To be in touch with what is happening right here and now. To relax‚Ä¶at last.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-applying-mindfulness-to-how-we-communicate-with-others""><strong>Applying mindfulness to how we communicate with others</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take time to observe yourself while you are in the middle of a conversation. What‚Äôs going on in your mind? Are you completely present, ready to listen to the person in front of you, or are you preparing the answers in your mind before they are even done talking? Are you attentively listening to what they are saying, or are you trying to relate it to your own life and experiences?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is, of course, natural to try to draw parallels with our own experiences when we want to understand and analyse what someone shares with us. This is how we make sense of other people‚Äôs stories. It would be unrealistic to try to communicate with others from a totally blank slate, completely detached from our own past.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">But it is possible to find middle ground. A point between being completely absorbed by our own stories and unable to really listen and being totally open minded and hearing what others are saying without relating it to our own history. Mindfulness allows us to reach this middle ground.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Using mindfulness while communicating with others simply means taking the time to be truly present. During a conversation,  means paying attention to the body language of the person who is talking, being open to their emotions, really sharing the moment with them, besides actively listening to their words. To be able to achieve this, we need to learn to put ourselves aside a bit, and give some space to the other person during the exchange.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This mindfulness exercise can be quite difficult for some of us. However, it‚Äôs important to try in order to build real relationships based on genuine listening, and, consequently on trust and openness.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-mindfulness-in-the-kitchen""><strong>Mindfulness in the kitchen!</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Living mindfully is a concept that can be adapted to every aspect of our lives.  is much simpler (and much more enjoyable) than you might imagine it to be.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Rest assured: you don‚Äôt need all the time in the world to be able to cook and eat mindfully. Actually, it won‚Äôt take any more time than usual. And yet, you will probably feel like time is slowing down. It‚Äôs true! Because when you do the exercises needed to be fully present, you will experience each minute as it actually is: 60 full seconds.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Why do you think that as we get older time seems to go faster and faster? The reason is that the more we go on in life, the more responsibilities we get, the more our minds get filled with things to accomplish, with appointments, and to-do lists to check off. But one thing is for sure: whether we are two or fifty years old, one minute still lasts exactly the same amount of time. So, why not enjoy your meals and live each minute fully by savoring each bite and enjoying the unique aromas of your dish?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Cooking and  completely changes our relationship with food. First, we start to really enjoy eating. Secondly, eating more slowly really helps with digestion. Finally, as we just explained, slowing down makes you feel like you are adding minutes to your life. So, are you ready to invite mindfulness into your kitchen? And while you‚Äôre at it, why don‚Äôt you do the dishes mindfully as well? Believe me: you‚Äôll find this activity, which seemed so boring before, much more enjoyable!</p>

   <h2 id=""h-working-mindfully""><strong>Working Mindfully</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you found a technique that allowed you to be faster and more efficient at your job would you be interested in trying it? Then look no further: the answer is mindfulness! It‚Äôs true, we become much more productive and perform much better when we do each task mindfully.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Did you know that being able to multitask is only a myth? In reality, our brain is incapable of doing more than one task at a time. What makes us think that we are able to multitask is our brain‚Äôs ability to quickly switch back and forth between tasks. But we are never truly able to completely focus on two tasks at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Rather than being an effective technique,  actually pushes us to be less effective at everything we do. When we divide our attention between tasks we lose our ability to truly perform and only fragment ourselves.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is why applying mindfulness techniques at work is such a great idea! When you focus on one task at a time you can truly pay attention to it and be simultaneously faster and more efficient. Plus, there is a good chance that your work will improve as well!</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To apply mindfulness to your work I suggest that you start by putting your phone on airplane mode as soon as you start working. Next, define the tasks that you‚Äôd like to achieve. Try using an agenda to organize your work day; this way you‚Äôll know exactly what you need to accomplish and in what order. Finally, consider using a timer to divide your work day into blocks of time separated by breaks. Remember that the breaks are just as important as work: without breaks you will be a lot less efficient. By  as well as during your breaks, you will increase your productivity and you‚Äôll have more time to do things other than work!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs your turn now: tell us, do you use mindfulness in your daily life? If you do, what techniques do you use and have you seen a difference? If you don‚Äôt, do you think that the techniques mentioned in this article might help in your daily life? Tell us more in the comments section! We look forward to reading your comments!</p>

Some people imagine sitting cross-legged in total silence, while others picture relaxing while listening to ‚Ä¶ Meditation exists in many cultures, and they use many different tools to transition into a meditative state. For hundreds of years, these teachings and practices have been passed down through generations through oral tradition. Although we have many written texts today, people still have questions about meditation. Meditation is a subjective concept, and there are differing viewpoints about what it ‚Äútruly‚Äù is.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-awareness-meditation""><strong>Awareness Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First of all, meditation is not something we actually ‚Äúdo‚Äù. Meditation is a state and way of being. There are hundreds of different tools and practices that can help us reach this state. We often refer to the use of these tools and exercises as ‚Äúmeditation‚Äù. One of the most popular practices is seated . The posture used in this meditation has become almost synonymous with the practice. The seated cross-legged posture called ‚Äú‚Äù in Zen Buddhism or the ‚Äú‚Äù sitting posture in Yoga teaching are two examples. However, meditation is much more than just sitting in this position. Our mind works like a factory constantly producing thoughts. Scientists believe that we have thousands of thoughts every day. We still do not completely know how thoughts work, or their underlying mechanisms and causes. Yet, with developments in psychology and with our continuing practice, it is possible to discover the nature of our minds and how they are affected by meditation.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-misconceptions-about-meditation""><strong>Misconceptions About Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <h3 id=""h-observing-thoughts-during-meditation""><strong>Observing</strong> <strong>Thoughts During Meditation</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most common  is the belief that it is about ‚Äònot thinking‚Äô. You may believe that, ‚ÄúSince I can‚Äôt stop thinking, I can‚Äôt meditate‚Äù or you may have heard similar comments from people around you. That is why many people lose their interest and motivation for meditation. Trying to stop or block our thoughts would mean waging a war against our minds. Instead, meditation involves noticing and becoming aware of the flow of thoughts through our minds. Are your thoughts too intense today? You can try to focus on this. Or is your mind still like a pool of water? Allow yourself to feel both the joy and transience of this state. The main thing is to increase our sensitivity to and awareness of all our states, as they change from moment to moment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, where do we start? Instead of pushing our thoughts away or getting angry at ourselves when a thought pops into our mind, we can start by observing our thoughts without getting too involved in them. My teacher once shared an analogy which I found very insightful, ‚ÄúImagine you are watching a movie and there are knights in armour and preparing for battle. Later, they ride their horses to the battlefield and fight tooth and nail with swords in their hands. As the audience, we just watch them on the screen. But what if we were the knights, preparing for and then fighting in the battle?‚Äù Well, noticing the thoughts that constantly cross our minds, and constructing internal narratives about the past and the future is like going to war. However, meditation is like being an audience to your thoughts. The scenarios we create in our minds can be exhausting: the future is full of infinite possibilities, and it is pointless to dwell on past incidents over which we have no control. When we meditate, we look for the tiny gaps between thoughts, gaps where we can rest. As we practice noticing and embracing these gaps, we improve our capacity to observe our thoughts. It is just like building a muscle.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h4 id=""h-""></h4> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs not always easy to notice these gaps, as it can be hard to see where our thoughts begin and end, or when a new trail of thought emerges. But there are various tools we can use when we start to meditate. Though the most widely-known tools are breath and , there are many other tools that can guide us to a meditative space. Meditation does not necessarily mean sitting still or being silent. In fact, some teachings claim that the transition to a meditative space is only possible after we get rid of our excess energy through healthy channels. That is why the last pose in a yoga lesson is lying down to meditate. If sitting meditations have not worked for you so far, you can try moving meditation. Furthermore, we all have ways that we self-soothe, even though we may not realize it. For instance, doing arts and crafts might be your form of meditation. Have you ever been so caught up with what you were doing that you lost track of time? Perhaps dancing alone at home, swimming or taking a walk. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should seek a distraction from what is going on inside you by keeping yourself occupied. Any action that helps prevent you from over-thinking can be a form of meditation, and it is an excellent idea to try them!</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-how-long-does-it-take-for-meditation-to-work""><strong>How long does it take for meditation to work?</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another common misconception is expecting instant results. After spending some time sitting and , or using another meditation tool, it may be unrealistic to expect your mind to just empty. Just like any other skill, your ability to meditate will improve if you are patient and make it part of your daily routine. When your mind has spent years used to a specific level of activity it can‚Äôt change overnight. The transition from being inside your mind to being an observer is actually meditation in itself. It takes patience and compassionate persistence, both during a single act of meditation and throughout the whole process. In addition to being something abstract that we experience inside our own minds, meditation is also a physical process; as we move beyond our daily habits, new neural pathways are formed in our brain. It is completely normal for this to take some time. So, rather than aiming to be ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù at meditation, the main thing is to make it a routine part of your daily life.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-purpose-of-meditation""><strong>Purpose of Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Meditation is not about controlling your emotions or thoughts, or having a sharp focus. There are tools that we use to focus our mind, mainly using our senses. For instance, music or a gong is used in meditations to bring ourselves to the present moment via our senses. Many people also wrongly believe that your eyes have to be closed during meditation. In fact, you can use visual stimuli, shapes or colours during meditation. Sometimes, closing our eyes can even make us feel our inner space more intensely, and make it difficult to be present in meditation. If this happens to you, continue meditating with your eyes open.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, staying entirely focused on our sensations is in fact a transition phase. As you become familiar with the structure and scope of your mind and thoughts, you actually shift away from living your life under their control, and develop a different perspective. Meditation can be described as a journey of discovery of your inner space. As you explore this space, you can free yourself from being controlled by your thoughts. Over time, it will become easier to transition to a life lived in the present moment.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-benefits-of-meditation""><strong>Benefits of Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Challenging emotions and mental distress are another important issue. Meditation has the power to transform our lives through raising awareness. As a result, we can observe its benefits in many areas. However, not every type of meditation is beneficial at every stage of our lives. Therefore, it can be difficult to try to focus on and experience emotions or situations that we are struggling to deal with. Building awareness helps you to look at these emotions with a clear mind, but you should not feel forced to do so; awareness includes being able to see this need, as well.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Seeing meditation as a way to relax is another common mistake. Meditation has a soothing and calming effect, as it regulates our brainwaves and affects our nervous system. But meditating just to relax is an incomplete and biased exercise. While conscious awareness creates a soothing and relaxing space, it can also create a space where we become aware of uncomfortable emotions and thoughts. Meditation also involves noticing these states.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a result of the sedative effects of meditation, some people fall asleep while meditating or feel sleepy afterwards. This is very common, but if it happens all the time, it may be an indication of a tired mind or nervous system. If this happens to you, consider trying a different meditation technique, as meditation should not always lead you to drift off to sleep. Meditation is a practice that teaches us how to notice what we are and are <em>not</em> aware of. It is a state of cognition and being which marks the spaces in which we feel stuck or feel comfortable, and helps us to live life consciously. Do you have any preconceptions or beliefs about meditation? Have the judgments or expectations you had before starting practicing meditation changed over time? We would love to hear from you if this article has changed your perspective on meditation or meditation techniques!</p>

Looking for Balance in the New Normal üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>The early days of the pandemic were extremely difficult for us all, mainly due to the intense uncertainty we faced and the challenging actions we had to take to stay safe. While the change to our daily routine and normal social environment was very jarring, it was certainly even more difficult for those who actually came down with the illness. While we suffered in different ways, all of us experienced hardship during this period.</p> 
   <p>For some time now, we have been trying to adjust to the new normal and how that affects our daily lives. We may be going out more often now, meeting friends and even making vacation plans. While it may seem as if we are getting back to our old habits, we can never quite forget that this is a ‚Äònew normal‚Äô.</p> 
   <p>As the world begins to open up, we may feel less anxious, afraid or desperate than we did in the early stages of the pandemic. However, the fact that the virus is still with us means that our fears and worries are still valid. During the reopening process we need to stay conscious of the ongoing reality of coronavirus, and the fear and anxiety that comes with it, and balance this with our wish to get back to normal.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>The irony is that many of the things that make us feel good are now potentially dangerous. Spending time with our loved ones, doing things that we enjoy, traveling or exercising are now potential health risks. It is worth finding the time and arranging the logistics to do these things, since they have such a positive effect on our psychological and physical wellbeing. Yes, there were stresses in our past lives, but these were mainly due to the dynamics of our relationships. These problems could even prove insightful and beneficial if we took the time to dig deeper into their causes.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>We have much greater access to our old habits and friends now than we did during the first days of the pandemic. Although it is still very important to comply with the rules set by the authorities, we still have to use our own initiative and make our own decisions. This is a powerful reminder that we remain in control of our lives. This can help you to feel empowered, and even help you to achieve your potential. Not having options can, conversely, lead to stress and feelings of desperation.</p> 
   <p>Nevertheless, the virus still continues to cause problems in our lives. But we do have more freedom of movement, and we have started to feel stronger as we learn more about this new and unprecedented situation. We have now more experience, but we are still facing risk factors that require us to be more careful than before. This dilemma creates an important challenge for us to overcome during this process: while we remain conscious of our fears and worries we should still seek out the people and activities that empower us and make us feel stronger and more capable.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>During this reopening process, many decisions concerning our safety have been left up to us, and some people may underestimate the risks that we continue to face. One common way that people deal with uncomfortable decisions or emotions is to deny or repress them. This is true in many situations, not just concerning the coronavirus pandemic. We often deny or repress the difficulties, frustrations, sadnesses or anger in our relationships. Yet, this so-called solution often leads to other problems, because those feelings are still there; they just find other ways to manifest themselves. In the case of pandemic, many people have repressed their fears and worries. It is important not to shut yourself off, and to keep going with the reopening process even as the pandemic continues around us. But our fears and worries are triggered by a real threat, and they are a valid expression of our need for safety. We should allow ourselves to experience them in our body, mind and soul, and remember that they are quite normal. Our fears and worries should be acknowledged and accepted in order for us to take the actions we need to feel safe. Exercising, taking time for self-care, rooting and slowing down remain helpful ways to regulate such emotions.</p> 
   <p>Even in these new circumstances, some of us may continue to experience intense feelings such as desperation, anxiety and fear. Our fear of the virus can overshadow our desire to return to our old habits and blend back into life. In this case, we need to look at how we assess risk and make rational decisions.</p> 
   <p>Ask yourself: what triggers my fear and worry? What can I do to minimise them? Is my reaction appropriate? What kind of measures could I take to make me feel safe? Who can I talk to about my fear and anxiety? Who do I think is doing a good job of balancing their need to protect themselves while adjusting to the new normal? What kinds of things are they doing? Is the fear and anxiety I feel about coronavirus similar to my reactions to other experiences? Looking for the answers to such questions will help us to assess our circumstance in a more constructive way and decide what we can do to improve it.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>From the beginning, the coronavirus pandemic has forced us to deal with change and uncertainty. As we all have experienced in different ways, this can be very difficult since we are experiencing a real threat. In this process, we should allow ourselves to experience our emotions and feelings, identify our needs, and correctly evaluate our circumstances in order to stay safe and get the support we need.</p>

What's Holding You Back from Giving Meditation a Shot? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We‚Äôve all heard of  but not all of us may be aware of the full benefits of daily practice. Often confused with other relaxation techniques or yoga, meditation goes way deeper. Did you know that we have 12 to  every day? What‚Äôs even more shocking is that 80% of these are negative; as our lizard brain takes control, we can lose focus, vision, or simply lack direction. But that‚Äôs just the beginning. Whatever  we face in our life ‚Äî the loss of a job or a loved one, stress or anxiety, disease or recovery, and so forth ‚Äî meditation can be a huge help. Aside from helping us heal, meditation can improve our lives and make us more open to gratitude, forgiveness, and compassion. On top of all this, meditation has proven to improve the areas in our  that foster memory, focus, and learning. For many people, the science behind meditation seems new or incomprehensible. But the benefits of meditation are actually equally accessible to all. We just need to explore it and give meditation a go and find out what works for us ‚Äî and what we can take with us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-top-5-reasons-people-hold-back-from-trying-meditation""><strong>The Top 5 reasons people hold back from trying meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p>‚ÄúTouch your inner space, which is nothingness, as silent and empty as the sky; it is your inner sky. Once you settle down in your inner sky, you have come home, and a great maturity arises in your actions, in your behavior. Then whatever you do has grace in it. Then whatever you do is poetry in itself. You live poetry; your walking becomes dancing, your silence becomes music.‚Äù</p> 
   <p><strong>‚Äì Osho</strong></p> 
   <p>Here are some common misconceptions about meditation:</p> 
   <p><strong>Lack of time</strong>: Many of us live hectic lives. But that doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt find 5 minutes every morning and evening to try meditating. We find the time to drink, sleep, and eat. If you have time to breathe, that means you also have time to meditate.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>Fear</strong>: Starting something new can be exciting but also scary. Our fear of the unknown can prevent us from achieving our full potential. Meditation helps us fight fear and explore new things outside of our comfort zone by empowering our unconscious. Don‚Äôt be afraid of what you will discover about yourself.</p> 
   <p><strong>Misconception</strong>: I used to think that meditation was for monks (which is also the case) or Buddhists. I thought it was spiritual practice. Yet the beauty (and truth) about meditation is that it‚Äôs totally accessible to every person on earth. Anyone can benefit from meditation, whoever they are.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not for me‚Äù</strong>: Many people who lead physically active lives claim that meditation isn‚Äôt right for them. Meditation may seem like a Zen activity better fit for yogis or monks. But meditation can benefit us all, no matter our lifestyle or goals in life. The point is to embrace the right practice and make it part of your daily schedule ‚Äî or life journey.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>‚ÄúI will fall asleep‚Äù</strong>: When I first introduced meditation to my circle of friends back in Asia where I practiced in various countries ‚Äî from Buddhist temples in Japan and Thailand to yoga studios and retreats in Bali, Indonesia ‚Äî I heard a lot of people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm afraid that I‚Äôll simply fall asleep if I close my eyes‚Äù. However, closing your eyes involves focusing on the moment ‚Äî which requires .&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-are-the-benefits-of-meditation""><strong>What are the benefits of meditation?&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>Meditation offers us  to inner peace, happiness, transformation, and positivity. But it doesn‚Äôt work instantly. As we begin and then deepen our practice, we may feel some true benefits in the short-term. Here are some things that meditation can help with:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Healing</strong>: We all face dramatic events in our life (death, breakups, illnesses, job loss, accidents, surgeries, and more) as well as stressful events that can lead to anxiety or depression. As we experience life‚Äôs difficulties, our body, soul, and mind seek a quick ‚Äúfix‚Äù. However, meditation isn‚Äôt <em>medication</em>; rather, it‚Äôs a way of looking at ourselves with our eyes open wide and exploring what we can change, what we are, and how we function as human beings. By offering us a path to healing, we can rebuild ourselves and take a transformative journey to find our true self ‚Äî no matter how chaotic our life is.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Emotional regulation</strong>: We often lose control when we are deep in thought or experiencing intense emotions such as anger, fear, and anxiety. Meditation brings us to the moment, giving us space to regulate our feelings. As we explore the present and look at things without judgment, we learn how to manage our emotions. As life goes on, we find we have better focus, control, and awareness of our inner self, and stop being too hard on ourselves. We can learn to accept, let go, and open ourselves up to new levels of consciousness as we regulate our emotions.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Compassion</strong>: Compassion is a word that‚Äôs often misunderstood. It describes how we perceive other people‚Äôs pain or feelings. Compassion comes from the desire to relieve another‚Äôs suffering. All human beings are capable of experiencing compassion, gratitude, and love. Meditation enables us to embrace the concept, to feel it, and to live it every day. You might think, ‚ÄúBut wait, we live in a society where only wolves thrive. Why should I show compassion towards such people?‚Äù ‚Äî But compassion has no boundaries. The child within us feels compassion for the essence of every human being, each creature on earth, and each thing.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Self-love</strong>: We underestimate the importance of self-love, and wrongly associate with being an egoist or narcissist. Don‚Äôt confuse self-love with selfishness. Self-love is a crucial part of living a happy life without allowing yourself to be burdened. Meditation provides us with the right tools to cultivate self-love, which in return can affect not only our relationships with ourselves but with others, too. As we love ourselves more and understand our strengths and limits, we can develop a deeper intimacy both with our true self and with others.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <h4 id=""h-""></h4> 
   <h3 id=""h-so-how-should-i-start-to-meditate""><strong>So, how should I start to meditate?&nbsp;</strong></h3> 
   <p>There‚Äôs no right or wrong way. As with most practices, the important thing is to try. You could speak to a meditation teacher, attend a meditation retreat, explore diverse meditation techniques, and slowly find the path that is best for you. Or simply start meditating by closing your eyes, holding your back straight with palms positioned gently on our knees and facing up to the sky, and doing a body scan. Focus on each part of your body, from your head to your feet and from your feet to your head. Or you can just breathe in and out 4 times, for 5 minutes each day. That‚Äôs enough to say, ‚ÄúGuess what? I finally started to meditate.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">All living things need to eat. We eat every day, and yet  is complicated. Our digestive system, emotions and moods are in such a sensitive balance that food is much more than mere energy or sustenance. Emotions and thoughts have a huge effect on our eating habits. But what is behind this complex relationship, and how can our relationship with food change when we try to eat mindfully?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-our-relationship-with-food""><strong>Our Relationship with Food</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First, let‚Äôs take a look at humans‚Äô relationship with food. When you think about it, eating is actually quite simple: there‚Äôs a certain amount of energy, essential nutrients, vitamins and minerals that we need to ingest daily. These amounts vary depending on our body type, age and gender. When you look at&nbsp; how other animals eat, you see that they only eat when they are hungry, make it their priority and only eat until they are full. Similarly, toddlers are much more instinctive about how they eat than adults. The human brain is complex and many factors can disrupt our natural tendencies. Today,  are sadly on the rise. Sometimes we lose our appetite completely and sometimes we continue to snack even when we are full. It can be hard to figure out how to eat the right amount and type of food.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-emotional-eating""><strong>Emotional Eating</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are many reasons why we sometimes overeat or undereat. Many animals experience a loss of appetite . This is because digestion requires a lot of energy. When we are stressed, instead of ‚Äòwasting‚Äô that energy on digestion, our body uses that energy to solve our problem. However, ‚Äúemotional eating‚Äù can also be a common reaction to feeling stressed. So what exactly is emotional eating? Eating some foods gives us an instant feeling of gratification or happiness. This is due to the substances they contain; they satisfy the reward center of our brains. Sweet foods that are high in sugar are the leading culprits because sugar is quickly absorbed and gives us an instant rush of energy. In modern times, our lives move so fast that we don‚Äôt even have time to notice most of our emotions. We not only do not take the time to pause and  and be grateful for them but we also develop ways to avoid negative emotions instead of allowing ourselves to feel them. One of the most effective ways to avoid our feelings is to reach for food. Other unhealthy tools include alcohol, cigarettes or other harmful substances. Snacking is maybe the easiest, most accessible and fastest option. Moreover, food appeals to our senses and gives us great pleasure. When we cannot cope with a difficult emotion, instead of allowing ourselves to feel it or noticing what is happening inside us at that moment, we reach for ways to avoid facing the emotion and that give us instant pleasure. Once our brain gets used to this cycle, the same neural pathways are triggered each time we experience a similar situation and our body automatically craves food. This pattern of behavior has both emotional and intellectual origins, and&nbsp; can turn into as it has an impact on our blood and hormones each time we repeat it. So, when our eating habits become deeply ingrained in our brains, we can find ourselves snacking even when we aren‚Äôt  or emotion.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another reason why we overeat has its origin in evolution. Nowadays, it is very easy to produce sugar and we consume much more sugar than our ancestors who lived hundreds or thousands of years ago. Unfortunately, sugar and its derivatives are added to almost all packaged and ready foods. Plus these foods are easily accessible. However, sugar was a rare treat for primitive humans: fruit was the only real source of sugar for hunter-gatherer societies. Since there was no mass production of food, they couldn‚Äôt just go to the supermarket and fill up their carts. So, when they found a tree covered in fruit, their instinct was to binge and eat as much as they possibly could in order to get an instant rush of energy. We inherited this instinct to binge on sweet food from our ancestors. This behavior is embedded in our genes. So don‚Äôt feel guilty if you have a sweet tooth ‚Äì it is totally natural!&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another negative impact of our fast-paced lives is the weakened link between our mind and body. The pace of life in cities and the burdens we bear create tension in our body and nervous system. When we feel under pressure, we tend to disassociate from our bodies as a physiological response. The signals transmitting sensations from our body to our brain become weaker when we are stressed. In addition, as our mind races and our thoughts get more intense, it becomes harder to pay attention to those already weak signals from our body. Just like some scales become less sensitive over time, our ability to sense the needs of our body can also become reduced; this also includes understanding if we are hungry or full. Moreover, our needs and the things that are good for us , from day to day. When we become desensitized to the signals our body sends us, we begin to repeat actions that have worked for us in the past.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Social pressure can also have a negative impact on our mind-body relationship. The worst culprit is the idea of the ‚Äúideal body‚Äù. Popular culture tells us that only a few body types and sizes are desirable. As a result, we end up imposing these ideals on ourselves without questioning whether they actually suit or are . These ideal images differ over time as pop culture changes. Being overweight was considered a mark of beauty during certain stages of history, while being dangerously skinny was the definition of ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù at other times. Historically, there have been economic reasons behind these trends. For example, in times of scarcity being overweight implied that that person was wealthy and had access to food. Popular trends are just that ‚Äì passing trends that should have no impact on your personal body image.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Currently, we are bombarded with advice about nutrition, sports and diet in our daily lives. Everyone has an opinion ‚Äî from friends to doctors on TV shows, from diet books to . Medical experts are the best source, as they can help you understand your body. However, it is hard to separate how much of what we read and see actually comes from experts and how much is from lay people or even completely false. This bombardment of information is too general, and does not factor in our own body and personality. For example, while eating frequent, small portions may suit some people, it is better for others to have larger portions but fewer meals. Some people benefit from eating the same food and drinking the same beverages year round. Some days we are physically more active and need more calories. Some days we are more , so we reach out for food to soothe us. Trying to follow general rules instead of listening to our present state can be stressful. Society tells us that we should ignore our own needs. Instead, how can we build a stronger relationship with our body?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Based on my personal experience, my primary advice would be to get to know your body. Since adolescence, I have had problems with my body image and eating habits. I was able to overcome this step by step once I started to pause and listen to my body. Of course, this is not as easy as it seems. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-to-train-your-body-and-mind-for-healthy-eating""><strong>How to train your body and mind for healthy eating?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So what can we do to listen to our body and maintain ?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-slow-down""><strong>1. Slow Down</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you sometimes skip meals without even noticing or have digestive issues, start by slowing down how you eat. If possible, eat regular meals. When chewing, try to focus on each bite as much as possible without any distractions and make sure to chew your food thoroughly. Digestion begins in the mouth and experts recommend swallowing your food after chewing it to an almost soup-like consistency. This way, your stomach finds it much easier to complete the digestion.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Incorporating body scanning meditation into your practice is another great way to raise your awareness. To do this, you can try guided meditations or just simply take short pauses where you pay attention to each part of your body, from the top of your head to the tip of your toes. As you do this more often, it will get easier to notice the sensations in your body. This will help you better understand how the type or amount of food you eat makes you feel, and whether you feel the urge to eat because you are actually hungry or just by force of habit. Meditation helps us to become much more sensitive to the signs our body is sending us as we calm the voice of our mind.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindful eating is another important practice. This consists of examining your food carefully and noticing all its details. A great food to try this with is a raisin. First, take a raisin in your hands and start to observe it. Take the time to examine all its details such as its texture, color and smell‚Äìeverything but its taste. Spend at least five minutes doing this. Then, taste a small piece of it and notice how it feels in your mouth and how it tastes, focusing on every moment. You can spend up to ten or fifteen minutes eating a single raisin! You can also try this with another fruit or nut of your choice.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-2-consult-a-specialist""><strong>2. Consult a Specialist</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Even if you do not have a eating disorder or weight problem, you can always consult a specialist on how to become better in touch with your body. We all have different physical needs. For instance, you might have a sensitivity to a certain type of food. Food intolerance tests can be quite helpful if you experience discomfort after eating. In order for these tests to be useful, they should be held under the guidance of a physician or a nutritionist. Some people even believe that you can benefit from eating a diet based on your blood type. To learn more about this, you can consult an expert in the Hindu practice known as Ayurveda. One or more of these options might help you to better connect with your body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-are-you-really-hungry""><strong>3. Are You Really Hungry?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We mostly eat at set meal times by force of habit. You may actually be eating without being really hungry. There are many reasons why we eat besides actual hunger: we can be thirsty or simply bored. In addition, everyone has their unique circadian rhythm that affects when they feel hungry. So, try to notice when your body is giving you real signals of hunger. In that way, you can decide whether the feeling of hunger is a physical or emotional need.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We look forward to hearing the experiences and practices that have helped you to make mindful eating !</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-creation-of-our-vision-of-the-world""><strong>The creation of our vision of the world</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever noticed that we live in our own reality? Of course, we all live different lives. That‚Äôs understandable! But what we tackle here goes deeper. We are talking about how each of us perceives the world, differently, with our personal vision, looking at things through our own lenses.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So how do we create this ‚Äúfilter‚Äù that defines how we perceive the world in such a unique way?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Various elements play an important role in the creation of this filter, which we can also call our ‚Äúlenses.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First of all, it comes from our education. Our upbringing is key here: what we have been taught at school, what we learned and how we learned it, our relationships with our parents, and so forth. This learning represents the foundation of our ‚Äúlenses‚Äù or vision of what we believe to be true.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs take an example. Marc, a fictive character, grew up in a kind, . Marc has always been free and loved since he was a child. Today, as an adult, he lives his relationships with others with an open, kind, and respectful heart. It comes naturally to him since he learned to feel and behave in such a way during his childhood.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many beliefs come from our educational background. We are more or less aware of this process. Based on his vision of relationships, Marc might believe it would be useless to fight with anyone ‚Äî since every conflict can be solved in a . However, Fanny, Marc‚Äôs partner, who grew up in a conflict-driven family, might believe that anger and fights are the only way to solve issues.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In parallel with our education, there‚Äôs also our environment ‚Äî and natural surroundings ‚Äî which play a critical role in . A person who lives in a peaceful atmosphere doesn‚Äôt see life in the same way as an individual who experiences tension, for instance. Similarly, a warm environment (such as a tropical island) and a Nordic country where winters are long and tiring could result in two different visions of life.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">All these elements (our education, our environment, our relationships, our quality of life, our experiences‚Ä¶) build up our personality. Our personality is formed according to what we have learned, . It‚Äôs the true expression of our character and is constantly evolving.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is where our true freedom lies: we can always evolve, grow, and see things from a different perspective. We can always bring the necessary changes to our vision or lenses.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-misunderstandings-and-fights""><strong>Misunderstandings and fights</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our thoughts result from our beliefs.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For instance, if I believe that dogs are dangerous ‚Äî perhaps a belief I formed after being bitten by a dog ‚Äî I would automatically think that all dogs are dangerous. My friend, who loves dogs, would think, ‚ÄúWhat a cute dog!‚Äù when seeing the same animal in the street, while I‚Äôd be scared and would think of ways to escape.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our thoughts truly belong to us since they come from our personal history. In that way, they are also subjective. This is the main trigger of fights and misunderstandings. As each of us lives within our vision of the world, it can be difficult to understand the others around us, and vice and versa.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs take another example that many of us can relate to. Let‚Äôs put ourselves in the life of an imaginary couple, Jean and Fanny.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Jean prefers that the dishes are put away after each meal while Fanny truly hates cleaning up immediately after lunch or dinner. Everyday, it‚Äôs the same story: each time she finishes her meal, Fanny sits down on the sofa. Jean always feels the same: Fanny‚Äôs behavior makes him believe she wants him to handle the cleaning.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Months of living under the same roof under such circumstances go on and neither of them is capable of clearly expressing their point of view. Until one day, Jean can‚Äôt handle it anymore, and says ‚ÄúFanny, you really treat me like your handyman. I can‚Äôt take this anymore!‚Äù Fanny is shocked and can‚Äôt understand Jean‚Äôs sudden reaction. ‚ÄòHow can he even think this,‚Äô she may wonder.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When Jean explains to her that he feels insulted each time she sits on the sofa without having done the dishes, she replies, ‚ÄúBut I never asked you to do anything! In my family, we always handle the household chores <em>after </em>we finish eating since it‚Äôs our sacred moment of the day together. After all, I must admit I always feel sad that you never rest with me after we eat lunch or dinner, Jean.‚Äù&nbsp;</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, let‚Äôs look at this situation from an external perspective. On the one hand, Jean is upset by Fanny‚Äôs behavior and thinks he is the one who should take action. On the other, Fanny is sad that Jean prefers to clean the dishes instead of spending some time with her on the sofa.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For both of them, their visions and actions come from their upbringing and personality, which has been built over their life, based on their personal experiences.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can then think of the following: are our thoughts real or are they the result of our personal experience?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This example makes us think of how we live in  ‚Äî with little or no communication. Most of us have to occasionally tackle such misunderstandings, which are both natural and changeable, if we take the time to analyze them.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-compassion-the-key-to-open-and-kind-communication""><strong>Compassion: the key to open and kind communication</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">From the moment we understand that our vision of life, of others, and of the world is based on our personal story, we begin to understand how subjective it is: it‚Äôs truly within us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs only one solution to kind and open communication ‚Äî . Compassion truly affects how we perceive the world around us and how others act. In our daily life, we need compassion to interact positively with others.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We naturally tend to have more compassion towards children. We think it‚Äôs normal that a child may not understand one situation the same way adults do since the child doesn‚Äôt have the same experience.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">On the other hand, we tend to judge adults when they act contrary to our vision of the world. We think, ‚ÄúThey should this or that. They should not behave in such a way‚Äù. However, we completely ignore everything about them, about their experiences, and learnings.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs think like this for a while: if someone looks suspicious to us, we could also appear suspicious to them.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We may believe we own the truth and that we are the only ones who know how to behave. But, in fact, this represents a risk: that we may impose our vision of the world on others. Our vision is just the fruit of our personal story.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, this does not include situations that involve violence or , which should be dealt with differently. I refer to situations in our daily life where we tend to easily judge others: how we dress, how we communicate, how we eat, how we laugh, how we think and so on, that may look strange or different from our vision or habits.</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We should accept that our beliefs result from our personal story ‚Äî and we should rely on compassion to accept our differences, which are the biggest source of learning for all of us as human beings. Learning from others and learning different things are true gifts.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em>So now, let‚Äôs approach things in the following way: how does this article lead us to think and act differently toward others? Are we ready to be more open and kind, seeing the different people in our lives through compassionate eyes? Can we use compassion to understand others better? Please share your comments with us. We love to read what you think!</em></p>

The first half of 2020 has been hectic for us all, especially due to the pandemic: insecurities about work, home, and personal relationships have left us drained. Despite our best efforts to focus on our inner selves, many of us may feel a bit lost in such circumstances. The summertime is a great time to unplug, recharge, get rid of unwanted patterns, and truly start afresh. Taking time off helps us to look inwards, heal, bounce back from any difficult situations we may have experienced, and find inner happiness. Why is the summer so important to our wellbeing? And how can we properly disconnect, recharge, enjoy our summer, and look forward to healthy times ahead?&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Fatigue, stress, lack of sleep, bad moods, and overthinking can become overwhelming if we don‚Äôt take time off. It has been proven that holidays have a positive impact on our wellbeing, mental balance, and physical awareness.  refers to holidaying and taking time off as the greatest way to give ourselves a boost, depending on the length and type of vacation we take.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em>There are 4 main</em><em> associated with holidays:</em></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-stress-decrease""><strong>Stress Decrease</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The American Psychological Association found out that getting away from work and activities . As we tend to focus too much on our work, we feel unbalanced and worried that things may not work out. But what if we could just remove ourselves from the routine that is causing us anxiety or preventing us from truly enjoying life? Research has shown that a holiday that lasts more than 8 days can relieve stress and boost energy levels.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-improved-sleep""><strong>Improved Sleep</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When our mind is busy with dull, repetitive tasks, worries and thoughts, we may not be capable of . Poor sleep also affects our overall health. Waking up early when we‚Äôve been sleep deprived worsens our fatigue and, as a result, we may feel overwhelmed and drained. Taking some time off enables us to disconnect, forget about our worries and get back to deep, healthy, and regular sleep.</p>

   <h3 id=""h-enhanced-productivity""><strong>Enhanced Productivity</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">People who take time off and recharge have been found to be more productive. Holidaying offers us the chance to explore new sights and people, and gives us new perspectives on our life and our selves. This improves our happiness, which has a positive impact on our productivity. We can‚Äôt force ourselves to be productive all the time. We actually need to stop, look inwards, and then go back to our old life feeling recharged.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-heart-disease-prevention""><strong>Heart Disease Prevention</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Keeping up with an unbalanced lifestyle can drive us to anxiety, panic attacks, depression, and the risk of heart disease due to the poor lifestyle choices that we use to cope with stress (alcohol or substance abuse, for instance).  have shown that the lack of holidays can lead to women having a higher risk of heart attacks. On the other hand, people who take a vacation every year have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We understand the importance of holidays on our wellbeing and health. So what are the best ways to actually disconnect and enjoy our time off?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-activities-we-can-do-to-enjoy-our-summer-to-the-full""><strong>Activities We Can Do To Enjoy Our Summer To The Full</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here are some general tips for how to have a great summer. For a better summer experience, let‚Äôs unplug, avoid unwanted people or toxic environments, and reflect on ourselves.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-the-no-mobile-or-computer-policy""><strong>The No-Mobile or Computer Policy</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Turn off mobile phones and avoid spending too much time on screens. It‚Äôs a bad idea to read on a mobile phone, or waste time , especially when we are given a unique opportunity to let new energy enter our tired body and mind. So let‚Äôs switch off our mobile phones and computers and reconnect with our true selves.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-spending-time-with-ourselves""><strong>Spending Time With Ourselves</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Spending time alone ‚Äî or with ourselves ‚Äî has great benefits for our health, creativity, and sense of purpose. While loneliness can be damaging, finding some healthy time for solitude has as we reflect upon, explore, and understand ourselves better. We don‚Äôt have to be lonely when we spend time alone. We just need to appreciate our own company, develop self-love, and cultivate what matters to us. Walking in the forest can be a great way to spend some time alone without feeling lonely.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-exploring-new-activities""><strong>Exploring New Activities</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Why don‚Äôt we use the holidays to finally try some activities we always wanted to start? Finding our true core, passions, and what makes us shine is very important for our overall happiness. Discovering new activities such as yoga, meditation, cycling, or any other hobbies we are curious about, enables us to connect with ourselves and others. It also increases our level of serotonin ‚Äî the happiness hormone ‚Äî and involves our brain in something exciting, new, and enriching.</p>

   <h3><strong>Doing a Vipassana Retreat</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúInsight meditation‚Äù or Vipassana ‚Äî which means ‚Äúto see things as they clearly are,‚Äù dates back 2,500 years. As the oldest form of meditation in the world, Vipassana has proven to reduce stress levels, heal deep trauma, increase our general awareness of our body and mind, remove physical pain, and profoundly alter our view on the world and ourselves. The practice involves a 10-day retreat away from urban life and requires us to stay silent, contemplating nature, and focus on our breathing as we walk and sit.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-journaling-painting-reading-listening-to-the-sounds-of-nature-and-cooking-healthy-food""><strong>Journaling, Painting, Reading, Listening To The Sounds Of Nature, and Cooking Healthy Food</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs enjoy some time off to journal what wanders through our mind. We can write down our thoughts, desires, fears, dreams, and hopes, and record everything that comes to us. Let‚Äôs write down positive emotions to manifest new things to enter our life such as, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy, healthy, and I deserve love.‚Äù Calm, creative activities such as painting, reading, cooking hearty vegetarian food and  also gives us the required space to heal, recharge, and blossom again.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The summer holidays are on the way! Why don‚Äôt we take the blissful opportunity to truly disconnect and find inner happiness on the way? We can start journaling, meditating, and trying new sports or activities that can fill our life with instant, long-lasting, and joyful moments.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These days, we have started to hear the longed-for echoes of our ‚Äòold life‚Äô. Yet, there is  is no longer as safe as it used to be.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We have gone through a period that was hard for us to get used to. An ‚Äòenemy‚Äô that we had not known or expected infiltrated our streets, homes, and minds, and kept us from going about our everyday lives. And then, the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô appeared before us in an unfamiliar shape.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Despite the many challenging aspects of this process, at least the need for all people to feel safe was seen and acknowledged. We were given a simple solution to meet this need: staying home.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <h2 id=""h-how-do-you-feel-about-staying-at-home""><strong>How do you feel about staying at home?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Staying home was a rather peaceful experience for some of us, but overwhelming for others; regardless, it allowed many of us to feel safe. Furthermore, we were able to do this without being judged or questioned; we were even supported and applauded for it.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In fact, staying home resembled being a child in one way: we did not need to make important decisions. As children, our caregivers take on the duty of making sure that we are well and healthy, that our bellies are full and that we are alive, to ensure that we are safe and well by drawing boundaries as we learn about life. This is one of the aspects of childhood that many people long for: it was a time when responsibilities, decisions, measures, and even dangers occured and were resolved in the adult world, external to us. Ideally, our caregivers made us feel safe while all of this was happening.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The stay-at-home period was sort of like childhood because there were boundaries drawn to make us safe and we could be well as long as we stayed within those borders. However, while the idea of staying at home remains an option, it is no longer acknowledged by everyone as a solution. The positives of staying at home‚Äìusing it as an opportunity to pause, being in unity with others, the emphasis on common concerns and needs, the calm of the streets‚Äìhave suddenly been turned upside down. Staying home no longer resembles our childhood because those sharp boundaries drawn for us have now become blurred. It is as if , who had been setting the rules to protect us, yielded to their grown-up friends whose opinion differed from theirs, and told us it was ‚Äòour choice‚Äô whether or not to stay home. Everyone has started to make their own decisions and lives have begun to differ from each other.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this period, have you thought about how this change made you feel?</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-from-childhood-to-adulthood""><strong>From childhood to adulthood</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If we compare staying home with childhood, we can see this current transition period as adolescence. Adolescence is, for most of us, a period full of anger and frustration, because we face the fact that  and differentiate, but we do not yet feel competent enough to be fully part of the adult world. Whilst feeling weak and insufficient due to the confusion of being neither a child nor an adult, we are expected to act like adults. Just like today, as we do not yet feel competent or ready to face a world with a dangerous virus outside, yet we are forced to stand on our own two feet‚Ä¶</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-our-worries-in-the-new-normal""><strong>Our worries in the new normal</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, it is entirely up to us, and this can be quite worrying for some. The peace of being at home has been replaced by guilt, worry, decisions and fears. <em>How will I get used to my old life with these new fears? Can I go out now? Am I being too careless? Do I look too scared? What am I missing out on? How much longer can I stay at peace in this abnormal state while everyone is getting ‚Äòback to normal‚Äô?</em>&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is extremely normal to ask yourself these questions. All of this might be challenging for you. You might feel indecisive, trapped, . You might even encounter feelings which you do not recognize or cannot interpret during this transition period. It might be that this period reminds you of other times in your life when you experienced similar situations, and it might make you remember your feelings from those periods. Perhaps there were situations, people, and responsibilities that you could avoid while you were at home.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-embrace-yourself-and-your-feelings""><strong>Embrace yourself and your feelings</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">No matter what you are going through, try to lend an ear to yourself. How does your current situation make you feel? What positive feelings about this period are coming to an end? What are you losing ? What are your needs in this period? Can you express them? See what you can or do not want to do to fulfill them. When it seems hard, try to voice it.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You can try to use a skill which you acquired when transitioning from childhood to adulthood. Maybe you can say ‚Äúno‚Äù and draw your own boundaries, just as you did then, to unconsciously differentiate yourself from your family. Asking yourself questions about your needs, wishes, worries and anger, and defining your current state can help you to make decisions, express your state and draw boundaries. Once you draw your own boundaries, you can experience the pleasure of the gains of adulthood, as well as grieving over the losses of your childhood, as you have been doing for years.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, in which ways will this be a positive period for you? What are things you are excited about while approaching the end of your stay-at-home period? What kind of liberties will this transition period bring you? From people, feelings, and routines you have missed? Who will you be able to see again? What will you regain?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Whatever your answer is to these questions, there will be a renewed, flourished, stronger and unique you when all this is over. What has happened so far might have brought you to a better or perhaps more challenging place. Nevertheless, you have overcome many difficulties in every way, and you are still alive. You have evolved; perhaps you are tired, but you are stronger now. How does it make you feel to think this way?&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-look-after-yourself""><strong>Look after yourself</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Remember how you initially handled the uncertainty and fear shaped by this process and the concern about your health and safety! You looked at yourself, your inner resources; you were patient, maybe you experienced acceptance or maybe gratitude. You can do all this now as well. Do not forget that your ability to accept change has strengthened, just like a muscle. You are now stronger, better able to adapt, and more tolerant of uncertainty. If you are having a hard time, you should know that you can still stand on your two feet during this new order by listening to yourself, looking after yourself and showing compassion to yourself. You <em>can</em> overcome this process.</p>

Because, let‚Äôs be honest, that is not what matters most in life. What does matter is to be surrounded by caring people, to learn how best to care for our bodies while also enjoying the pleasures life has to offer, and to have goals that match who we really are (even if they don‚Äôt make sense to others!). Once these three key elements are in place, the rest will naturally fall into place. So, throughout this article, I will ask you real questions to help you to figure out who you really are, what you really want out of life and what are your next objectives. Let‚Äôs do it!<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-cleaning-up-our-personal-relationships""><strong>Cleaning up our personal relationships</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Knowing how to surround ourselves with good people is fundamental. In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes need to do some cleaning up in our relationships. Even just talking about ‚Äòcleaning up‚Äô our friend circle or even our family members may sound very cruel and insensitive. However, , without really being aware of it.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, how can we make sure that we are surrounded by caring people? How can we tell if the people around us are there to help us grow, make us laugh, give us a hand when we need it or comfort us during difficult times? Every person around us plays a specific role in our life; we tend to call  when we want to relax and other ones when we want to talk about problems in our personal life, for example.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When it comes to some of our friends or relatives, we know for a fact that their presence in our life is beneficial. Sometimes, though, we can have a conscious or unconscious feeling of uneasiness when it comes to our relationship with some people. Even without being able to pinpoint exactly why. In this case, it‚Äôs worth noting that that feeling of uneasiness alone is worth paying attention to. This feeling doesn‚Äôt come up &nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In such cases, to clarify what we feel towards this person, we can ask ourselves the following questions:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Am I relaxed when I am around this person?</li> 
    <li>Does this person allow me to look at my issues objectively or do they try to convince me that their point of view is the correct one?</li> 
    <li>Do I feel that this person tries to influence me in a way that feels uncomfortable?</li> 
    <li>Do I feel overall better or worse after having spent time with this person?</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Answering these questions will give us good insight into the kind of impact this person has on us. If, after answering these questions, we realize that the influence that this person has on us is either not very positive or even negative, we need to make the conscious choice of changing our relationship with them.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Depending on the type of relationship that we have with this person we can:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>completely stop having a relationship with them,</li> 
    <li>set up some boundaries and not be as available to them,</li> 
    <li>or, if these two options are not possible (which can be the case with a family member, for example), we can protect ourselves mentally by being aware of their impact on us. In this case, we can remember that we don‚Äôt have to believe everything that they say and that we can decide whether or not to let them have any kind of influence on us.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This exercise will help you be more aware of the good and the not so good aspects of your different relationships. With time, you will be able to surround yourself with people who have a positive impact on your life and  that are more challenging.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-listening-to-your-body-to-optimize-your-health""><strong>Listening to your body to optimize your health</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In order to go back to what really matters, we need to get rid of what is superfluous. While if this idea seems obvious, it‚Äôs often difficult to put into practice. Of course it‚Äôs all a matter of balance: a balanced life is not a life without pleasure or without healthy routines. On the contrary, a life built on restrictions and deprivation can be more harmful, in the long run, than having bad habits. Because, as we know,  is the enemy of a healthy body, and vice versa. Indeed, it‚Äôs all connected!<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, how do we create a healthy routine? Here again, nobody else but ourselves can know where our equilibrium lies. Instead of blindly starting a new diet ‚Äì because we have heard that it‚Äôs the healthiest way of eating ‚Äì we need to, first and foremost, . Clearly, no matter what our mind wants us to believe, we already know that we can eliminate from our diet anything that is too sweet, too salty or too fat as well as most pre-packaged foods. Other than that we need to relearn to listen to our real desires, because they usually match what our bodies need the most.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You hate celery but you were told that drinking a glass full of celery juice each morning would give you an amazing amount of energy each day? Listen to your body: it‚Äôs not going to work for you. However, you love berries? Well that‚Äôs a good way to enjoy yourself while doing something that is also good for you. And, above all else, don‚Äôt be scared of exploring. Follow these guidelines: firstly, put away anything that is clearly harmful to your health. Then, , starting by eating the foods you enjoy and that are healthy. Take back control over your eating habits by eating things that are good for you, and only you. Once you‚Äôve sorted out what you like and don‚Äôt like, start learning about a good way to balance your meals, and find your balance.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once you have learned how to eat healthily and in a way that you can sustain, I suggest that you follow this rule to create a healthy balance: follow your healthy routine 5 to 6 days a week and forget about any of the rules the rest of the week.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This balance, which may seem counterintuitive at first glance, is a way of telling our brain and body that everything is possible, and that nothing is set in stone. But this technique also has another advantage: with time you will get used to the benefits of the healthy routine you created. As a result, even on days when the ‚Äúrules‚Äù are left out, you will tend not to overdo it, because you‚Äôll know the pleasant feeling of feeling good about your body and being in tune with your needs. That‚Äôs when you know you‚Äôve reached nirvana; when being healthy becomes pleasurable, that‚Äôs the best place to be!<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-professional-and-personal-goals-what-really-matters""><strong>Professional and personal goals: what really matters?&nbsp;</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our personal and professional goals tend to be guided by what we think we ought to be doing and not by what we really like and enjoy.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A simple question can help you be aware of what really matters to you: how would you like to be remembered? What footprint would you like to leave in the world?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here, there is no question of making a value judgment between certain careers, certain activities and other ones. It is simply a question of being open to a deep honesty towards oneself. Does the path I am following resemble me, match who I am and my values? Do I give myself the opportunity to move in a direction that ?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is how you can think about what really matters to you. While you think about your relationships, your health and your life goals, always remember this: what you discover is right for you and for you alone. If you start to wonder what your mom, your best friend or your grand-pa would think about it, you lose sight of the goal of this exercise. Here, what counts is to find your balance and no one else‚Äôs. This is the only way to give the best version of yourself to the people around you.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, tell us in the comments: do these questions help you see more clearly what really matters to you and to achieve your goals? We would love to read what you have to say!</p>

It is vitally important to give your child the opportunity to speak about these worries or concerns. However, once they have aired these, there are plenty of ways to  in letting go of this weight holding them down. What I have found most helpful is to aid children in visualizing letting go of what is bothering them. The easiest way to do this is by describing a vivid and descriptive scene and allowing the child to immerse themselves in this moment in their mind. I have attached some ideas below that have proved successful. Before each one, ask your child to find a comfortable, quiet spot, allow their body to ‚Äúmelt‚Äù or ‚Äúturn into jelly,‚Äù and take some deep breaths.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-balloon-worries""><strong>1. Balloon Worries</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Ask your child to imagine a big balloon of any shape. Talk about how it is their favorite color and how it dances in the air above them as they hold the string tightly in their fist. Describe how it floats around in the wind and add any other details to create a vivid scene. Then explain to your child that we will fill this balloon with our worries. Can they feel it getting heavier? It is too much for us to hold and we do not have to. Ask them to visualize letting go of the string and allowing the balloon to gracefully drift up and away until it is out of sight.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-beach-worries""><strong>2. Beach Worries</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are plenty of wonderful words to conjure up a stimulating image or memory of being on the beach. Describe the sand between their toes and the water lapping against their ankles. Next, ask them to imagine a boat, raft or their favorite sea creature coming to the shore to meet them. The child can unload their worries to the raft or the creature and slowly watch as they disappear into the sunset.</p>

Explain that this plant is there to accept any worries they are feeling. Allow them to attach their concerns by speaking to it, attaching their worries with a ribbon or leaving a basket beside it. The important part here is to allow the child to walk back to their safe place in their mind, leaving the plant or basket behind.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-4-bubbles""><strong>4. Bubbles</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is a slightly different technique that focuses on what the child needs to feel or be surrounded with at a certain time. It involves asking children to use their special slow,  and pretend to blow imaginary bubbles around the room. The child can visualize that these bubbles are filled with ‚Äúcalmness,‚Äù ‚Äújoy‚Äù or ‚Äúprotection,‚Äù depending on the circumstance.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-5-positivity-walk""><strong>5. Positivity Walk</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is more of a ‚Äúmovement meditation‚Äù in which children walk mindfully around their space and think of all the things they are grateful for in their life. They can think of any positive aspect, no matter how tiny. When they think of something to add to their mental list, they can stop and ‚Äúbreathe it in‚Äù to help store it in their mind.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These are only a few of the techniques that I have found that work wonders with my more anxious pupils, but the internet is full of inspirational people bursting with creative ideas ‚Äî so get searching and find what works for you and your little one. Remember, this will end. Until then, stay safe and stay calm.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-are-you-feeling""><strong>What are you feeling?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In this unexpected new global era ‚Äî in which and our daily activities have been suddenly altered ‚Äî have you paused and asked yourself how you feel? Or have you just kept moving along and trying to get through your normal routine? Turning our backs on our emotions can often feel easier than facing them. With that being said, sooner or later our emotions still demand to be expressed, seen, and accepted. When we ignore them, they can sometimes shift in order to catch our attention and become physically and mentally disturbing. These ignored emotions may end up surfacing as feelings we can‚Äôt fully make sense of, such as anxiety, agitation, or uneasiness. Or they can manifest themselves in the form of physical discomfort, such as pain or insomnia. They sometimes appear in the relationship we have with ourselves or those close to us; they may impact our relationship with food or work. That‚Äôs precisely why opening up space for our emotions is so crucial for our well-being and our ability to lead a balanced life.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you been able to make sense of what you‚Äôve been experiencing so far during this pandemic? What‚Äôs happened, and what‚Äôs changed for you? Right now, what kind of&nbsp; emotions are rising up because of this situation? What do you most feel the absence of, or what do you miss? For example, you might miss being outdoors or running errands without . You may feel sad due to not being able to see your loved ones. If you‚Äôre living with others, you may be feeling overwhelmed by never having any time alone. And if you‚Äôre living alone, you might be feeling isolated and lonely. Not knowing how long this will actually last can add to those emotions even more. However you may be feeling, it‚Äôs absolutely normal and understandable; we‚Äôre all going through this in our own ways. Yet rather than dismissing and ignoring our feelings, by observing what emotions we‚Äôve been experiencing during this period, we‚Äôll be much more able to understand what our needs are. And once we become aware of these needs, we‚Äôll have an easier time at coping with and processing this new ‚Äònormal‚Äô.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-your-losses-and-grief""><strong>Your losses and grief</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, worry, fear, confusion, and exhaustion. Calm, hope, and happiness. These are all feelings we may be experiencing during this pandemic period. We‚Äôre probably familiar with most of these emotions, but there‚Äôs another emotion we‚Äôre likely experiencing during this time as well: grief. These days, you may be grieving many things you‚Äôve suddenly lost. Perhaps you lost a loved one, or a loved one may be ill and seeking medical treatment in more difficult conditions than usual. If either of these situations apply to you and you‚Äôre struggling in any way, seeking out a mental health professional can help you during this painful time.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, while many of us fortunately haven‚Äôt lost anyone close to us, this pandemic has still caused us to experience loss and grief in ways that are perhaps more abstract. This experience of loss may be disorienting and painful in its own way. For instance, you may have lost or control over your life. You may be missing your habits, routines, being close with loved ones, or perhaps your job. What have you had to let go of&nbsp; during this period? What has been suddenly taken away from you? What kind of things are you deprived of that used to make you feel good? What feelings are you missing that these routines used to bring? Happiness? Feeling loved? Trust? Calmness? Tranquillity? Fun? Grieving these mental states and feelings is very normal. Try putting names to these emotions and open up space for them by listing on a sheet of paper or in your journal what you feel you‚Äôve lost.<br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In addition to the types of emotions mentioned and the experiences , this pandemic‚Äôs disruption of your future plans may also be challenging. You may have been dreaming about new things to do in the upcoming months or you may have upcoming plans or traditions that won‚Äôt go as planned. All of these situations can cause us to feel sadness or frustration. And while most of us may dismiss these changed plans and missed opportunities as trivial, trying to convince yourself that you don‚Äôt feel upset or disappointed can end up with you feeling even worse later on. Instead, try to think of these changes in future plans, and the uncertainty of the future in general, as another form of loss to identify and work through. Journaling or talking with a loved one are both great ways of expressing your feelings about these losses.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-can-you-do-to-cope-with-grief""><strong>What can you do to cope with grief?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Noticing grief and making room for it are the first steps towards healing. If we ignore what we‚Äôve lost and our grief, it may affect our well-being, relationships, and bodies. Here, we‚Äôll cover some suggestions to help ourselves become more aware of the grief we‚Äôre feeling:<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-set-aside-time""><strong>Set aside time. </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In order to prevent grief from dominating your life while still making room to process it, set aside some time to just grieve whatever it is that you‚Äôre missing, craving, yearning for, or lamenting. During this time, you‚Äôre free to reminisce, dream, have a look at old photos, check canceled or pending plans and, if you need to, cry. This time can be a space for you to experience how your losses make you feel. Even though facing these feelings during a scheduled time may sometimes seem challenging, it can help you . And most importantly, you‚Äôll be creating a space for your own healing by observing and caring for your emotions.<br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-listen-to-your-needs""><strong>Listen to your needs. </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Knowing that other people are going through similar difficulties can sometimes relieve our own feelings of stress or pain. However, we shouldn‚Äôt forget that everyone has their own experiences and forms of grief. Rather than focusing on how others are getting through the pandemic, we should remind ourselves that everyone is experiencing this period in different ways. Everyone has their own personality, life experiences, needs, and reactions. Even though we‚Äôre all facing the same event, it‚Äôs useful to ask yourself, ‚ÄúHow do I feel during this period and what do I need?‚Äù Don‚Äôt forget that you don‚Äôt have to think positive and be strong all of the time. Try to write down your feelings and needs, or share them with someone you trust. If you‚Äôre feeling worried, try to list your worries and put them in groups. Afterwards, listen to what the emotion you‚Äôre sensing at that moment means to you. For example, worry can often be related to feeling safe and the need for control. So if the emotion you are experiencing is worry, it might feel better to  that you can control, that require you to be present, and that make you feel good.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-create-a-new-routine""><strong>Create a new routine. </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you had to give up some of ? We may have had to change some of our daily rituals that are just impossible to maintain right now. Rituals like going to the gym before work, having lunch with your friends once a week, chatting over coffee with a friend, or your day-to-day work routine. But what if you created a <em>new </em>routine to make reading the news or drinking coffee more enjoyable? For instance, you could create a new ritual while you drink your coffee and video chat with a friend. Or instead of going to the gym before work, do your workout at home or in your yard first thing in the morning. Your new routine can even involve a hobby you‚Äôve been meaning to try for a while, a language you want to learn, or a habit you‚Äôre trying to pick up. Think about planning new routines that enrich your life and bring you closer to your dreams.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-explore-joy""><strong>Explore joy. </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Even though this period has taken away some of the things you love, consider that the new rhythm you‚Äôve found yourself in <em>may</em> also create space for new opportunities. What are some of the emotions, memories, and experiences you can create and share that are special to this unique period we‚Äôre in? Right now, all across the world, everyone‚Äôs experiencing the same fear, worry and longing ‚Äî people from different cultures, and people you‚Äôll never even meet. Perhaps this stillness in the streets has allowed you to notice sounds in your neighborhood or home that you‚Äôd never noticed before. Maybe you can start to spend the time which you‚Äôd normally spend commuting to work making a great breakfast, meditating, or . Maybe you‚Äôre now spending more time with your child, partner, family, or roommates. For the first time in years, you‚Äôre experiencing being together all day long, day after day. Or this may be the perfect time to notice what lessons and revelations can come with solitude. You might be able to take the time to reflect, or perhaps come across corners, drawers, and memories in your home that you‚Äôd forgotten. The point is, even though this period is challenging, finding some opportunities to experience joy is more important now than ever. If you want, take a moment to list out some things you <em>have </em>appreciated or enjoyed<em> </em>during this period.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-create-your-own-peaceful-space""><strong>Create your own peaceful space.</strong> </h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Imagine a peaceful and relaxing space that only contains things that make you feel good. Music, candles, writing, doing yoga, talking to a friend, meditating, playing games, supporting your community, being alone, reading a book, or starting or continuing therapy‚Ä¶ this space may include these things, or any other activity you can think to add. During this period, try to make room in your new routine for connecting with these activities; things that fill your cup and make you feel at ease or fulfilled. To help put this into action, whenever you‚Äôre planning out your days, make sure to write in a time (it could even be just 5 minutes) when you get to do something for <em>you.</em><br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-meditate""><strong>Meditate. </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The practice of meditation gives you the opportunity to see how you‚Äôre feeling and makes you feel more in-control when it comes to these emotions. When you take your mind off of auto-pilot and are actively present, it‚Äôs easier to identify any feelings of grief you may have and make space for them. When you‚Äôre having trouble focusing and everything becomes too much to take, you can give your mind a break by meditating. If your mind is lost in the ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and other fears and uncertainties about the future, meditation can help your mind relax and reconnect to the present moment. You can also practice and experience emotions like compassion and acceptance through meditation, both of which may help ease anxiety. Compassion and acceptance help stop us from running away from our feelings and disassociating from the situation we‚Äôre in.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Especially during these challenging times, observing what we‚Äôre feeling, identifying our emotions, and expressing them can help us feel better. We can use that information to prioritize and guide our daily routines and choices. Many of us aren‚Äôt used to feeling emotions like grief in the specific way we‚Äôre experiencing them now. But when it comes to this specific situation, paying attention to these feelings of grief can be one of the first steps in our healing journey.</p>

The ‚ÄúFear of Missing Out‚Äù and Mindful Use of Social Media üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The use of social media is increasing every day. The number and age range of the people using it, as well as the time and energy spent on the platforms, are all increasing. These social platforms are also huge business markets now. This causes a high level of interaction between people, celebrities, brands, products and so on.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The ‚Äúfear of missing out,‚Äù or FOMO for short, has become a widespread form of worry in our tech-focused era. It‚Äôs defined by always being stressed about missing out on something, mostly due to the effects of social media. Or, we could also say that FOMO is about ‚Äú.‚Äù We‚Äôre highly affected by everything we see through our social media accounts: the stories, tweets, memes and so on. In fact, it‚Äôs the case that social media was used less frequently and more naturally in the past. It was more likely that you saw what the people you follow were really doing or snapshots of their important moments. However, as people started to create and post more and more content, we now see the same kinds of patterns in captions or the same types of photos. There seems to be a certain framework to people‚Äôs posts, almost like it‚Äôs a competition. Even the creation of personal content has started to feel like a business. Few posts these days seem to be authentic footage or glimpses into other people‚Äôs lives.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôre exposed to too much content from other people ‚Äî so much that we can get lost in it. The smooth action of scrolling down the screen with our fingertip is easy, but this action gives way to an unfortunate and vicious cycle.  in our brains feeds on novelty. Constantly receiving new information stimulates the release of a neurotransmitter called dopamine, a molecule that is released when we discover a path that takes us to a reward. Scrolling down through new visual or written information constantly triggers dopamine release and tells our brains that this is the path to a reward. However, our dopamine level eventually gets depleted, which is why we want to spend more time on our feeds ‚Äî&nbsp; and why we become uneasy without it. A more advanced stage of this addiction to social media is losing interest in other activities, since they are less stimulating in comparison.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-mindful-using-of-social-media""><strong>Mindful using of social media</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Unfortunately, not everyone uses their social accounts mindfully and in moderation. People seem to share their happy and fun moments, their fancy meals, the places they travel to or their hectic social life. We tend to assume that the things they share with us constitute their whole life. You might see celebrities or wealthier people using some product or going to different locales, and you may question why you can‚Äôt do the same.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is how we start to compare our own life and belongings with those of other people. It starts to seem to us like our happy or fun moments are a relatively small part of our lives overall compared to what we see others doing. It feels like everybody is out there having so much fun, but we‚Äôre not.&nbsp; Then we start to feel like this vividness is lacking from our life, and we‚Äôre constantly missing out on whatever is out there.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, most of us do alter our behavior, even if just in a small way, in order to feel like we‚Äôre catching up with the rest of the world. It‚Äôs completely normal if you experience feelings of FOMO as well. We forget the fact that people are carefully selecting what they share ‚Äî they might even spend hours doing this. They usually only share what looks ‚Äúgood.‚Äù It‚Äôs that simple. There are happy, social moments in everyone‚Äôs lives, but there are also painful or sad times in very similar proportions. No one likes to share about a financial crisis or a fight with their partner, for instance. Instead, it‚Äôs almost exclusively positive moments that are shared ‚Äî even if they don‚Äôt reflect all the emotions or situations the person faced that day.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"" id=""h-for-now-here-are-some-things-you-can-start-to-do-yourself-if-more-and-more-people-follow-these-tips-we-can-start-to-make-a-change-around-how-we-use-and-feel-about-social-media"">For now, here are some things you can start to do yourself. If more and more people follow these tips, we can start to make a change around how we use and feel about social media:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">1. Always remind yourself that your life can be private. It‚Äôs fine if you just share something with close friends. You can try sharing special times and memories just with yourself by staying present and enjoying the moment. Share joy with the people you‚Äôre physically together with, or, if you‚Äôre by yourself, focus on commemorating or appreciating your experiences just for yourself.<br><br>2. Think twice before passing judgment about the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù posts that other people make, or the stories they tell. You can never be sure what they‚Äôre going through in their personal life, or how they reflect their moods in their posts. They may even be upset or sad. Try to be grateful for what you have in your own life right now. If you want to learn more about this and practice, check out Meditopia‚Äôs Gratitude section.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">3. Reduce and limit your social media usage. If you feel like you check your apps automatically, you might consider going on a social media break for a couple of days, or even weeks. You can either delete the apps or temporarily freeze your accounts. You can also change the location of social media apps on your phone screen so they‚Äôre not as accessible, or log out from your account every time so that checking them is more difficult. This way, you can reduce the number of times you reach for your phone without realizing it.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These simple adjustments may help you stay in touch with the present moment. There‚Äôre endless possibilities to be concerned with what we might be missing outside. But instead, let‚Äôs keep our focus on not missing out on any of the important moments that are happening right now in our own lives.&nbsp;</p>

   <p>We‚Äôve all heard about how emotional intelligence influences our perception of ourselves and the world around us. Life is an ever-changing process, and our ability to embrace that change is key to leading a fulfilling life. Emotional intelligence allows us to create stronger habits so we can better pursue our purpose. It provides us with a framework to process our emotions and gives us the tools to ultimately become happier in our lives.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Part of emotional intelligence is how we process our emotions and digest information about our inner self through self-awareness. Self-awareness and emotional intelligence go hand-in-hand, since we need to be knowledgeable about our own emotions to truly understand our inner selves.</p> 
   <p>So what is emotional intelligence exactly? And how is self-awareness critical to forming stronger bonds with ourselves and the people around us? Why should we work on self-improvement at any stage of our lives? Let‚Äôs explore this topic further by digging in a bit more on what these terms mean and how they can help us improve our self-awareness.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-do-we-define-emotional-intelligence-1""><strong>How do we define emotional intelligence?</strong></h2> 
   <p>We define<strong></strong> as the ability to process our emotions in positive ways in order to express how we feel and to help manage difficult situations. Emotional intelligence includes four pillars, which are:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Self-awareness</strong>:<strong> </strong>Self-awareness is our conscious knowledge of ourselves ‚Äî including our character, desires, dreams, feelings, fears, weaknesses and strengths. This internal picture of ourselves helps us define our boundaries with others and how we should behave or process our feelings in a specific situation.</li> 
    <li><strong>Social awareness</strong>: Social awareness<strong> </strong>is our capability to put ourselves in others‚Äô shoes and have empathy (social sensitivity) towards those around us. Social awareness also includes compassion toward others and understanding what drives them, such as their feelings, motivations, fears, or desires.</li> 
    <li><strong>Self-management</strong>: Self-management<strong> </strong>describes our skills when dealing with our life, including the ability to understand more about ourselves. It includes recognizing where we could improve and taking actions to guide this positive change. Self-management also encompasses our actions to build a happier life.</li> 
    <li><strong>Relationship management</strong>: Relationship management<strong> </strong>involves our broader empathy towards those around us and our ability to deal with others and their emotions.<strong> </strong>Strong relationship management skills help solve conflicts and improve relationships with others at home or at work.</li> 
   </ul>

   <h2 id=""h-how-does-self-awareness-relate-to-self-improvement"">How does self-awareness relate to self-improvement?</h2> 
   <p>Every human being, no matter where they are in life, can benefit from increasing their degree of self-awareness. Learning more about our emotions and feelings helps us connect with the people close to us, and helps us reach our goals in a positive way. However, processing difficult feelings is also part of becoming more self-aware. Increasing self-awareness requires consciously understanding our emotions, whether they be negative or positive.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Self-awareness is our first step toward. If we don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on inside us, we may make poor choices about our own well-being. We may feel uncertain or anxious or feel doubt about our path in life. Self-awareness is very important for our emotional stability overall.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-tips-on-how-to-build-better-habits-when-it-comes-to-self-awareness""><strong>Tips on how to build better habits when it comes to self-awareness</strong></h2> 
   <p>Let‚Äôs start by asking ourselves three questions to start with so we know where to go next. This three-step process will help guide us towards a stronger sense of self-awareness.</p> 
   <ol> 
    <li><em>Do I know what I am feeling right now?&nbsp;</em></li> 
    <li><em>What are my dreams telling me? What are my feelings?</em></li> 
    <li><em>Which people do I want to surround myself with? Who do I trust?</em></li> 
   </ol> 
   <p>The following techniques can also be helpful:</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>Meditation and visualization</strong>: Meditation invites us to sit down, breathe, and relax, and helps us increase our. Various meditation techniques can help us toward building a stronger sense of self. Metha is a style of loving-kindness meditation, for instance, while vipassana is a deeper technique that asks us to look inside ourselves without judgment.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li><strong>Set up goals</strong>: We can set intentions and focus on. This involves concentrating on the small actions we can do every day in order to reach a bigger goal, not the goal itself.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>As we are better aware of what we feel, we are less afraid, making it easier for us to have healthy relationships. Self-awareness guides us toward building stronger habits to improve ourselves, which is all part of our personal journey of growth. With various techniques, from journaling to meditation, we can feel confident and fulfilled about our personal journey as we learn more about who we are.</p>

In the last couple of years, I can say that I‚Äôve made some progress in solving this problem, but sometimes I have nights like last night. Now, I practice yoga and meditation regularly, and I teach both as well. No matter how sensitive you‚Äôve become towards your body, even if you don‚Äôt experience any physical or psychological disorders, and even if you have an organized life, you may experience sleepless nights at times.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-why-am-i-having-trouble-sleeping-at-night""><strong>Why am I having trouble sleeping at night?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First of all, let‚Äôs go over an issue that is probably familiar to all of us: You‚Äôre supposed , but your thoughts and mind are very determined to keep you awake. You might be writing down a list in your mind, one by one, of the points you‚Äôll say in next week‚Äôs meeting, you might be planning what you‚Äôre going to cook tomorrow or which part of the house you‚Äôll clean. Or maybe an old conversation keeps turning in your head.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The good news is: You‚Äôre not alone! Because of the increasing pressure of daily life and our level of exposure to screens, many people experience this in modern life. Irregular sleep is an inevitable result of social and economic pressure and . We might be experiencing increased levels of anxiety about our health, our loved ones, economic concerns, or the uncertainty of the future. As a result, our brain is telling our body that we‚Äôre facing a life-threatening situation. This results in physiological reactions that cause our body to stay stimulated. This is also probably why the frequency of sleep issues seems to have increased during the worldwide pandemic.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In this article, I‚Äôll talk about a few techniques based on my own experience of teaching and practicing yoga. These techniques can help you address sleep problems step by step.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-be-aware-of-the-reasons-for-sleep-deprivation""><strong>Be aware of the reasons for sleep deprivation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The first important point when it comes to these practices is that we should be aware of the possible reasons behind our sleep issues. We should try to address these problems patiently and without pushing ourselves too hard. Moreover, we should definitely switch off before we go to sleep. If you want to read more about how blue light from our devices affects our sleep, you can check out . Secondly, we shouldn‚Äôt expect magical or instant results from any of these techniques. Instead, we should focus on making them part of a routine. Remember that it‚Äôs important to form a habit by being both consistent and persistent. Here is an example of a possible pre-sleep routine that might be useful for you:&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-yogic-tips""><strong>Yogic Tips</strong></h2>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-staying-mindful""><strong>1. Staying mindful</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you already practice mindfulness regularly during other parts of your day, you can also include a mindfulness meditation or any other form of meditation that is suitable for pre-sleep. However, in order to make this routine sustainable for yourself long-term, my advice is to have a five-minute mindfulness session after you‚Äôre done with all your activities and you‚Äôve put your phone down. Observe your breathing and your body in a room and posture that makes you feel comfortable. This can be done sitting on the floor or lying down in bed. Observe your physical environment and the sensations in your body. If possible, there should be no light or sound. During the exercises I describe below, your awareness should be on your breathing and the parts of your body that are changing along with your breath.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-bending-forward""><strong>2. Bending forward&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">All the poses in which we bend forward are ideal for calming our mind and body and for getting prepared for sleep. While on the floor or in your bed, rest your upper body on your legs for a few minutes. Don‚Äôt push yourself to stretch too deeply if you feel stiff ‚Äî this should be a relaxing pose. While doing this pose, you should bend forward from your hips. You can put a pillow or folded blanket between your legs and stomach to soften the pose. You can also put the soles of your feet together and drop your knees to the sides. If you do this, you can adjust the pillows and the distance between your feet.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another pose that is perfect for getting ready for sleep is child‚Äôs pose. For this pose, sit down in bed or on the floor with your feet under you and fold your torso over your legs so that your hips are over your heels. If needed, adjust the pose by putting pillows or blankets under your stomach. Your arms can stay next to your heels or you can lay them in front of you.&nbsp;</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-twists""><strong>3. Twists</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Twists are ideal pre-sleep poses in terms of relaxing the body along the spine. To do this pose, lay down and then fold your knees and legs up towards your belly. Then wrap your arms around your knees and let your knees drop together to the ground, either on your right or left side. Then open your arms in a T shape and turn your upper body to face away from your knees, keeping your shoulders on the ground. You can do this pose on alternating sides for a few minutes.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-4-viparita-karani-pose""><strong>4. Viparita Karani Pose</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This yoga pose is said to be the ‚Äúremedy for everything.‚Äù When it comes to sleep issues, it may help in  that has accumulated due to standing up or sitting down all day. While lying down in bed, put your legs against the wall. The key here is that your hips should touch the wall. You can also raise your hips with pillows and blankets. If you are using support under your hips like a blanket, it should create space between your body and the floor or bed. Your arms can rest at your sides. Enjoy this relaxing pose for a couple of minutes.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-5-nadi-shodana-breathing-exercise""><strong>5. Nadi Shodana Breathing Exercise</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For this calming , fold the index and middle fingers of your dominant hand together and put them against your palm. Using your right thumb, close your right nostril and inhale from the other one. Then close the left nostril with your ring and pinky finger and exhale from the right one. Now, inhale again with the same nostril that you just exhaled from, without moving your hand. You should change your hand after you inhale and exhale once per nostril. You can repeat this sequence ten times. If you can‚Äôt breathe through one of your nostrils, you can try pulling your cheek softly with your other hand. While this exercise helps with allergies and colds, you can also practice it for meditation.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One last extra note: Burning incense with a strong scent before we go to sleep may affect our breathing quality. However, a few hours before we go to bed, we can use relaxing essential oils in a censer or incense burner, or we can apply massage oils or lotions. Don‚Äôt forget to ventilate the room!&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After trying this sequence, you can change the order of the exercises however you wish. Do you have your own  or any techniques that help you fall asleep? We would love to hear from you if you practice this routine or if you have any pointers of your own! Please share with us in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all go through changes in our lives, small or big. But how do we deal with things when everything changes? How do we build a new life from scratch when we move to a new city or even a new country? How do we cope with the solitude of not knowing anyone, of not knowing how the new place works, or how people think? Sometimes we don‚Äôt even speak the language of the new place properly. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I have been moving around for a while now. It‚Äôs not so easy in the beginning ‚Äî not for anyone. And that‚Äôs even if you have help from a company to deal with all the paperwork! So here, I‚Äôll share 7 tips based on some of my experiences and the things I‚Äôve learned moving from one place to another.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-1-remember-your-why""><strong>1) Remember your WHY</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When you start to think about moving to a new place, the first thing you should have clear in your mind is why you‚Äôre going there. It doesn‚Äôt matter what the reason is, but it matters a lot that you‚Äôre sure why you‚Äôre leaving your life behind to start a new one. It can be helpful to write down a list of all of your reasons until you‚Äôre 100% sure that you‚Äôre doing something you want. This list won‚Äôt magically make things easy in the new place, but it‚Äôll help you when they‚Äôre not. Knowing what you want and why you made the choices you did will help you to move forward and not let the difficulties scare you or make you give up.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-2-do-your-research""><strong>2) Do your Research</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever been to the place you‚Äôre moving to? If you have gone as a tourist, keep in mind that visiting a place and living there are two very different things, for both the good and for the bad aspects. So, try to get to know the place as best as you can. Go online and search for blogs and videos of people who already live there and see what they have to share about the new city. Is it a place where you can rely on public transportation or should you consider buying a car or a bike? What are the characteristics of that new place? Are the stores always open like in big cities? Do they have a different timetable? How‚Äôs the health care system, and how‚Äôs the renting market?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-learn-your-pleases-thank-you-s""><strong>3) Learn Your ‚ÄòPleases &amp; Thank You‚Äôs‚Äô</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> where you don‚Äôt speak the language is a challenge. You might be going to do exactly that, learn the language, or you might be going with your spouse because of their work. Either way, it‚Äôs a very nice thing to start studying the language and culture. You might start a language course before you move, so you‚Äôre more familiar with the language when you arrive. You can use apps to help you build your vocabulary as well. Another thing you can do that helps a lot is get a language exchange buddy, with whom you help teach your native language and vice versa. This is also a nice way of making new friends. Usually, people are very happy to see you trying to speak the native language, so don‚Äôt be shy and practice every chance you get.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-4-make-friends""><strong>4) Make Friends</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Making new friends is never easy. The older people get, the more settled they become. This isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad or a good thing, but it happens regardless. We read a lot about , but in this one case, in particular, social media can be your salvation. There are websites for ex-pats and Facebook groups all dedicated to helping new residents make friends in the city. They are also very helpful for getting tips about the new city, like nice courses, coffee places, bars, events, or whatever you like. What‚Äôs more, you can start looking before you move, so when you get there you‚Äôll feel more welcomed and not so lonely.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-5-make-moving-easier-for-yourself""><strong>5) Make Moving Easier for Yourself</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The actual move can be tricky. If you‚Äôre not going alone, you might be moving with your furniture, and that can be expensive. Depending on where you‚Äôre coming from and where you‚Äôre going, it‚Äôs nice to consider just selling everything you have and using that money to buy new things at your new place. The reason is practical: for instance, if you move from an area where the houses are big and spacious to a city where small apartments are more common, your things won‚Äôt fit and you might have to get rid of them anyway ‚Äî and that‚Äôs after moving them all the way to the new place. There are usually apps online that‚Äôll help sell your things in your old city and other apps to buy furniture in the new city. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-6-be-patient-with-yourself""><strong>6) Be Patient with Yourself</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Keep in mind that the more you can take care of the practical and bureaucratic things in advance, the more you‚Äôll be able to enjoy your new city. Little things tend to seem bigger when we‚Äôre away from everything we know, so try to prepare yourself as much as you can. At the same time, be aware that things won‚Äôt be perfect and there‚Äôll always be something you didn‚Äôt think about because you simply couldn‚Äôt have known. So, never forget to be kind to yourself, because moving to a new place is often an amazing experience, even though you‚Äôll find some bumps in the road.<br></p>

Re-Learning How to Follow Your Intuition üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We have become used to thinking before we act, choosing wisdom over impulsivity, and reason over spontaneity. At first glance it would seem like using our sense of reasoning to advance in life, avoid making mistakes, and reach success, is a good idea. But is it possible that we have learned to overthink and that it is to the detriment of our intuition? Could the fact that we have so much knowledge, that we use rules, logic, and common sense be preventing us from trusting what we feel? Have we become our own prisons? In this article, we will see how our thinking brain has taken over to the detriment of our inner voice and how we can learn to use our intuition as a powerful ally to achieve a more fulfilled life. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Unlearn overthinking in order to learn to listen to our inner selves</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Ever since we were children we learned to call everything into question, to think of the consequences of our actions, and exercise caution.&nbsp; As children, we often heard words of caution: ‚Äúbe careful, you‚Äôre going to hurt yourself,‚Äù ‚ÄúThink before you act or you‚Äôll make mistakes,‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be so messy, stay attentive and stay between the lines to make a pretty drawing.‚Äù Of course, these warnings came from a good place when our caregivers were only trying to protect us and help us learn some new skills.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>And then it was the teachers‚Äô turn to warn us about possible consequences of acts done without much thought. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt think about your future and what you want to become when you grow up, you‚Äôll end up with a job you don‚Äôt like.‚Äù And above all else, society as a whole has always put pressure on us to be more serious and judicious: ‚ÄúIf you eat this, you‚Äôll end up with diabetes,‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt exercise you‚Äôll have heart problems‚Äù‚Ä¶ So we have learned and integrated the idea that spontaneous, thoughtless, and impulsive acts would most likely lead to negative consequences.<br></p> 
   <p>Regardless if we have more of a rebellious or a disciplined personality, these ideas have an undeniable effect on our image of the world and on how we should act. People with more of a rebellious type of personality would have a tendency to act <em>against</em> these ideas. If we are more disciplined, we would have the natural tendency to <em>follow </em>these guides and their recommendations thinking we are doing the best we can for ourselves and those around us. In each of these cases, we are heavily influenced by society‚Äôs governing rules. The behaviour we choose to adopt is therefore not entirely natural but is influenced by these rules.<br></p> 
   <p>So, if it is unthinkable to imagine a society without rules, why is it still important to learn to think less in order to move towards a life that really suits us?<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>The tyranny of the mind</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Thinking too much stops us from moving forward. How often have you pondered a question as simple as ‚Äústrawberry or banana?‚Äù When faced with such choices, we always have a first reflex, an answer, that jumps at us right before our mind starts thinking: ‚ÄúYum, a strawberry!‚Äù And then, in less than a second we start thinking: ‚ÄúA strawberry sounds good, but bananas are more nutritious‚Ä¶I also read that bananas are full of potassium and my doctor told me that I am low in potassium, so a banana would be much better for me‚Äù‚Ä¶‚ÄùBut a strawberry would be so good! I don‚Äôt really feel like having a banana‚Ä¶but I‚Äôll still be hungry if I only eat a strawberry!‚Äù&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Does this scenario sound familiar to you? Don‚Äôt worry, you are definitely not alone. With this example, I‚Äôm sure you understand better why calming our mind to make room for action, spontaneity, and life is vital. Being too careful and thinking too much simply stops us from appreciating the simple acts in life, from making a leap into the present.&nbsp; Imagine if you‚Äôd follow each and every recommendation that you‚Äôve heard and read to improve your health, raise your children, clean your house, have a happy romantic relationship, be more organized, more efficient‚Ä¶It would simply be unbearable. <br></p> 
   <p>In our minds, we naturally sort through the advice that we receive and that would influence our choices. We instinctively know that without some sense of freedom we can‚Äôt be happy. We do not usually mindlessly follow ideas that are coming from others, but what about the ones that we impose on ourselves? <br></p> 
   <p>We tend to believe that our lack of freedom of action comes from outside ourselves. When we feel suffocated we blame our job, our obligations, our partner, our children‚Ä¶However, a large part of it comes from our own mind. We create our own prison. Our beliefs, history, fears, wants ‚Äì in short, our ego ‚Äì dictates what we can or can‚Äôt do. Our greatest tyrant is inside our heads and is the main reason why we feel we don‚Äôt have control of our lives.<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Waking up our intuition and spontaneity</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Rest assured, you can regain control of your mind and start feeling mentally lighter, all while exercising self-care and go forward in life in a healthier manner. But to reach this goal you need to learn to listen to your intuition. I‚Äôm sure you know what I am referring to. That gut feeling that we often hear about, but that seems elusive and difficult to grasp. Each and every one of us has intuition, but most of us were never taught how to use it. What I am proposing to you today is to find the keys to your mental freedom by learning to listen to your intuition. However, because your intuition is deep within you, if, like most of us, your mind has always taken over, you will need to do some work to find it and awaken it.<br></p> 
   <p>So, what‚Äôs intuition exactly? Our intuition is like an innate form of intelligence that is unique to each of us. It‚Äôs an internal process that doesn‚Äôt require logic, thinking, or knowledge. Our intuition gives us access to our true nature. It‚Äôs the part of ourselves that is calm, is aware of what is good for us, for those around us, and for our environment. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Why should you awaken your intuition?</strong></h2> 
   <ul> 
    <li>To learn to trust your unique view of the world.</li> 
    <li>To make choices that are right for you.</li> 
    <li>To make decisions that really matter to you.</li> 
    <li>To express your true personality without fear, in complete freedom.</li> 
    <li>To not fear the unknown and novelties of life.</li> 
    <li>To lead a more spontaneous and exciting life!</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>As incredible as it seems we all have the keys to leading a more fulfilling life that is unique and makes perfect sense for us. But to achieve this goal we need to learn to detach ourselves from our minds. The best way to reach this goal is, without a doubt, to start meditating. By meditating daily we start to find a balance between our mind and our intuition. Thanks to this balance we can go forward in life with peace within ourselves and act freely, by using our mind when it‚Äôs necessary but without letting it take over constantly. <br></p> 
   <p>So, are you ready to start trusting your intuition? Tell us in the comments: in the future what would you like to be able to achieve in your life without overthinking? Answer below, we‚Äôd love to read your thoughts!<br></p>

Supporting Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We can all agree that right now throughout the world we‚Äôre all experiencing a pretty unique and surreal situation. What has been happening across the globe over the past couple of months is affecting every one of us in a different way, triggering different reactions and emotions within each of us. And it‚Äôs not just us adults who are impacted by this; children are relying more than ever on their parents, guardians, and teachers for guidance and support on how to cope with this experience. But how can we offer our children perspective and comfort when we, ourselves, sometimes feel like we‚Äôre reeling from one moment to the next? Today we‚Äôll share some useful suggestions that may support you in helping the children in your life manage this uncertainty and change.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-are-you-feeling""><strong>How are </strong><strong><em>you</em></strong><strong> feeling?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>First, before thinking about how you can best support the children in your life, it‚Äôs important to pause for a moment and check in with yourself. How have <em>you</em> been feeling throughout this whole experience? Angry? Scared? Confused? Worried? Stressed? Numb? Maybe a mix of them all. However you‚Äôve been feeling, give yourself the permission to acknowledge and really feel those emotions. It‚Äôs completely natural that you‚Äôre feeling a mix of strong emotions. You may be feeling frustrated trying to  while attempting to homeschool or entertain your kids. You may be angry at the fact that all of your plans or trips have to be cancelled. Perhaps you‚Äôre feeling a great deal of sadness and compassion for others you know who have been significantly impacted by this pandemic.<br></p> 
   <p>Know that whatever you‚Äôre feeling is absolutely normal and is no cause to feel guilty, responsible, inadequate, or like you‚Äôre failing. Every adult‚Äîevery one of us‚Äîhas a child inside of us. And especially during uncomfortable or challenging periods, this inner child tends to react much more strongly to the smallest of changes, fears, or uncertainties. That being said, we can all acknowledge that right now we‚Äôre experiencing a great deal of all three of those triggers. So in addition to tending to our own children, we first need to acknowledge and soothe our inner child. Ask yourself what you can do to calm this inner child? What do you need right now? What would help you feel loved and supported during this time? Invite a conversation with your loved ones to share with each other what support you each need the most during this time. It may be 15 minutes a day of just quality conversation, a long hug, dancing, journaling, exercising, or participating in your favorite hobby at home. Now, more than ever, we need to acknowledge what we need to show up as our best selves, not only for our loved ones, colleagues, and friends, but for ourselves.<br></p> 
   <p>What support systems do you have in place? How do you generally cope with and overcome challenges in your life? If you were to imagine yourself in a relaxed and secure place, what would that look like?<br></p> 
   <p>As an extra tip, I‚Äôd recommend writing the answers to these questions down. Seeing these thoughts written out on paper will help ground you and also serve as a reminder to take care of yourself throughout this period of time.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-explaining-the-situation-to-children""><strong>Explaining the situation to children</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>By taking the time to check in with yourself and observe how you‚Äôre feeling, you‚Äôll find it easier to explain to a child what‚Äôs currently going on right now. ‚ÄãOne thing to consider is that children pay more attention to the way something‚Äôs being told rather than what is being told. That means that while explaining the situation, we should be very mindful of the tone of voice we use, our facial expression, body language, and emotional state. The emotions we express can easily be picked up by children, impacting the way they interpret what‚Äôs happening and how they react to it. For this very reason, how you react and interpret these circumstances is very important. Notice, did your mind immediately resort to cynicism or optimism? Did you say to yourself something along the lines of, ‚ÄúOf course this is happening; something bad is always happening and that‚Äôs just the way it is‚Äù, or were you thinking to yourself, ‚ÄúOkay, this is a really difficult situation, but we‚Äôll overcome it and soon it will pass and things will be better.‚Äù Notice what usually comes to mind; generally those thoughts will greatly impact how you‚Äôre feeling about the whole situation, and however you‚Äôre feeling will absolutely be conveyed to the children around you and serve as a queue for how they react.<br></p> 
   <p>As you may be picking up on by now, how you support your children during this process will also be an exercise in better understanding how you handle anxiety, change, uncertainty, and fear. This experience can serve as an opportunity for you to explore your tolerance for uncertainty and how willing you are to accept things that you can‚Äôt control. Based on what you learn about yourself, you can ask yourself the following questions and consider the answers. Why is it difficult for you to accept that you may not be able to control everything that‚Äôs happening in your life? Do you always try to control everything? Why do you think you feel the need to do so?<br></p> 
   <p>Find a moment when you‚Äôre feeling at ease and explain to the children the situation in a clear, gentle, and calm manner. If the child is still quite young, you can make a story out of it, or you can explain it with a drawing. You can explain the Coronavirus as being a cousin of the flu, something they more easily understand. You can mention how once it enters the body, it causes a cough, fever, cold, and fatigue. Assure them that there are so many smart and dedicated people working on finding a cure and that each of us has antibody soldiers in our bodies that can help us fight off this sickness. You can explain to them that they can support their soldiers by taking precautions like washing their hands, sneezing into the crook of your elbow, and staying home for a while. It‚Äôs important to remind your child that they‚Äôre healthy and safe. What your child needs most right now is to know that their health comes first and that, as their parent, guardian, or teacher, you are doing everything to preserve it.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-opening-space-for-emotions""><strong>Opening space for emotions&nbsp;</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Once you‚Äôve spoken to your child about this difficult time, creating a space for their thoughts and feelings is one of the most important parts of managing the process well. What comes to their mind when they see and listen to the things happening around them? Do they have any questions? You may not have all the answers, and that‚Äôs okay to express. Sometimes, if you feel it would be appropriate and helpful for them to know, you can search for the answers to those questions at a later point and follow up with them afterwards with a thoughtful answer.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>If they enjoy drawing, you can ask them what color these feelings would be and what shape they may look like. You can ask them what they may need from you to help feel more comfortable, safe, and loved. What makes them feel happy right now? Give them the space to talk about these and feel free to turn these questions into a game or story! Speaking of games, playing a child‚Äôs favorite game is a great way to relieve fear and anxiety, and not just for the child! They can even invent their own game, giving them the space to write their own rules, express themselves, and interact with their loved ones.&nbsp; Your only job is to observe the child without interrupting and without judgement. In this way, the child feels that their emotions are accepted and embraced; they are heard, seen and understood. All of this calms them down under these difficult circumstances and allows them to feel safe.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-making-it-easier-for-your-child-to-deal-with-difficult-emotions""><strong>Making it easier for your child to deal with difficult emotions&nbsp;</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>When you see that your child is having a hard time coping with their difficult emotions, you can explore together how to deal with them. Here are some suggestions that may seem obvious but are easy to overlook. Physical contact with a trusted, loved one automatically calms us down and triggers the oxytocin hormone that makes us all feel safe. For example when your child seems scared or anxious, hug them, hold their hand, and keep that physical contact to soothe them. Laughing out loud or crying can also release stress. Being active can also help your mind and body relax. As much as you can within the confines of your home or garden, try to get moving with your child. Perhaps do some jumping jacks, wrestle, enjoy some frog jumps, or dance! You can even try to meditate, reflect, or read together.&nbsp; Activities like cooking, listening to music, playing with silly putty, water, a bowl of beans, or applying essential oils can help children regulate their feelings. As things continue on, you can inform your children about new developments or rules that will directly impact their daily lives. That being said, be mindful of what other information sources they‚Äôre exposed to. For example, it may be stressful or nerve-wracking for a child to be constantly hearing the TV on with breaking alerts and commentary constantly flooding their environment. So perhaps limit the time you have the TV on and be wary of what they‚Äôre listening to.<br></p> 
   <p>Because they‚Äôre little and dependent on their parents, children have limited space where they feel active and in control. To be calm and secure, they need to feel that they‚Äôre in control. For this reason, it‚Äôs important to stick to their daily routines as much as possible. Additionally, they can manage a space that belongs solely to them and no one else. This could be taking on responsibility for a household chore that is suitable for their age, like watering a plant. They can prepare a plan for one of their dreams they want to realize once this period is over and hang it on their bedroom wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-protecting-boundaries""><strong>Protecting boundaries</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Since during this time our families are spending more time together, oftentimes in the confines of our own home, there may be times when patience and frustration boils up. Boundaries may shift and this shift can lead to us feeling overwhelmed, exhausted, and emotional. That being the case, it‚Äôs so important to create some healthy boundaries and time for yourself. This also includes creating a new daily schedule and routine for your family that everyone is on board with and abides by. This schedule can include play time, nap times, quiet time, time to focus on quiet activities, and time to eat and relax. As a parent, especially, establishing boundaries that keep you well-rested, calm, and peaceful will help you be a better parent and show up with more heart and energy.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>As a final reminder, please keep in mind that it is unrealistic to expect that your life and emotions right now will feel normal during this crisis. Coping with so many changes, fears, and uncertainties, having to accept so many things outside of our control‚Äîit‚Äôs challenging all of the parts of us that crave stability, consistency, and security. Be gentle and patient with yourself and your children, give yourselves the permission to feel those uncomfortable emotions, and most importantly, be there for one another.</p>

Why The Grieving Process Is Completely Yours To Navigate & How Meditation Can Help üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Grief is an extremely painful but personal process. No matter what anyone says, there is no right or wrong way to grieve.</p> 
   <p>Your friends and family may feel like it‚Äôs their responsibility to guide you through this process and impart their opinions about the best way to deal with it. While their approach is probably well-meaning, outsider thoughts about your grief can become overwhelming and unwanted, especially if these ‚Äòintentions‚Äô completely contradict or ignore your feelings or wishes.</p> 
   <p>Although some people may never relate to your personal grief, this doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt care. The most important person to remember, however, is you. Here are 6 ways you can combat societal judgments about grief and learn from meditation techniques to help cultivate compassion for yourself as you weather the emotional storm.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-there-s-no-getting-over-it""><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; There‚Äôs no ‚Äògetting over it‚Äô</strong></h3> 
   <p>Grief does not come with an off switch. An irrevocable loss or trauma is not something you can simply undo or easily come to terms with. You may encounter the view that you should ‚Äòget over it‚Äô, which is not only hurtful but highly insensitive. No one can understand the depth of your pain, except for you. Chances are the people giving this advice are not coming from a malicious place. It‚Äôs highly likely that what your loved ones actually want to say is that they miss the ‚Äòold you‚Äô. They too, are reconciling with your grief and coming to terms with how this process has impacted both your life and theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Meditation for grief can not change the reality of the loss that has occurred for you either. However, it can assist in helping direct your attention to a calmer and more focused place, encouraging you to take care of yourself during this challenging time. Whether you practice deep breathing or set aside a time in your sacred space,  in any form can provide a moment of calm in an otherwise stressful time.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-there-s-no-set-time-limit-to-heal""><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; There‚Äôs No Set Time Limit To Heal</strong></h3> 
   <p>Some cultures suggest there is a period of time in which the grieving should begin and then complete as healing occurs. You may even have heard the expression, ‚Äòtime heals all wounds‚Äô. In reality, there is no amount of time that will replace a person‚Äôs place in your life or even your memories with them. In some cases, there is no recovering from grief but rather, a coming to terms with the pain.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>For most of us, it is simply a matter of getting through a myriad of emotions from one day to the next. Mindfulness meditation can help us to focus on where we want our emotions to be, overcoming blocks to healing by placing awareness in fond memories, rather than sitting stuck in trauma-based emotions.</p>

   <h3 id=""h-3-your-grief-is-yours-and-yours-alone""><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Your Grief Is Yours and Yours Alone</strong></h3> 
   <p>It‚Äôs okay to ask for advice, but at the end of the day, it‚Äôs up to you whether or not you accept it.</p> 
   <p>As uncomfortable as it can be, it‚Äôs important to clearly define your boundaries. Clarify that your grieving process is not a topic for discussion and therefore is not something that deserves judgment or unwanted ridicule. When you‚Äôre feeling low, the last thing you want is for your emotions to feel invalidated.</p> 
   <p>Meditation can help you delve into your own inner wisdom, to identify what your mind, body and soul need to feel supported during this time.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-4-you-don-t-want-to-hear-generalized-clich-s""><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; You don‚Äôt want to hear generalized clich√©s</strong></h3> 
   <p>It‚Äôs natural for your loved ones to want to console you through this grieving period. Statements such as ‚Äòthey‚Äôre in a better place‚Äô, ‚Äòat least they‚Äôre at peace‚Äô or ‚Äòit could be worse‚Äô can actually have the opposite effect to their intended meanings. There is a clear difference between parroting over-generalized quotes and applying mantra meditations to help you when you feel scattered or like you can‚Äôt wind down.</p> 
   <p>You may choose to dedicate a special space to undertake this practice, supported by photos of belongings of your loved one, or even a. Create your own routine, by sitting upright in a comfortable position and bringing your hands together in a prayer pose in front of your heart. Breathe deeply as you listen to or say your chosen mantras. There are many beautiful mantras for healing you can find online. It is important to choose those that speak to you. Trust your judgment.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-5-painful-feelings-are-natural""><strong>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Painful Feelings are Natural</strong></h3> 
   <p>Without a doubt, feelings of depression and sadness go hand-in-hand with grief.</p> 
   <p>There is an inherent societal belief that suggests that positivity is the instant cure to all sadness. But unfortunately, wanting to feel happy is different from actually experiencing happiness. The implication that you should try to ‚Äòremain positive‚Äô disregards the complexity of your grief. In fact, suppressing grief and presenting a happy fa√ßade can have adverse effects on your health. When painful feelings are repressed they fester and escalate, resulting in more issues down the line.</p> 
   <p>It‚Äôs easy for people who are unfamiliar with loss to tell you to focus on the bright side because in reality, they have nothing to compare your emotions to. Pain is natural and definitely not something you should feel ashamed or afraid of. Pain is a process you have to experience in order to move forward.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>There‚Äôs no denying that grief will irretrievably change your life. Grief will change your routine, your personality, your natural processes as well as your relationships (and that‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing). Once you experience loss, the way of life you once knew will reshuffle into something unrecognizable. At times you will feel that this grief is impossible and senseless.<br></p> 
   <p>Meditation will remind you that you are living a human experience in which we all suffer. The techniques applied through daily practice of meditation, have been helping people liberate themselves from suffering for millions of years. It can help you manage the physical symptoms of tension and headaches, improve the quality of your sleep and build your immune system back up. Most importantly, you will experience an expansion in compassion for yourself and for your loved ones, so you will feel less alone in this difficult time.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-to-lead-a-healthy-lifestyle-while-balancing-your-schedule""><strong>How to lead a healthy lifestyle while balancing your schedule</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With the million things I have to do every day, how can I stay healthy at the same time? That‚Äôs a question we may all ask ourselves when we put our head in the pillow at night. We all have a busy schedule ‚Äî we might be studying, working, taking care of kids or relatives, taking care of our home, and so on. So, how can we fit , exercise and meditation into our endless to-do list?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôre like me, when you think about this and try to find the time, you get overwhelmed. And this tends to happen in big part because we want to do it all, and not only that, we want to do everything both perfectly and quickly. But the thing is that creating new habits and , and it certainly doesn‚Äôt happen overnight.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, let‚Äôs think about this one step at a time.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-examining-your-goals""><strong>Examining your goals</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What is it that you really want? Have you stopped and thought about it? You may want to be healthier, but that‚Äôs a very general statement. So let‚Äôs take a few minutes and write down not only what we want, but why we want these things. We‚Äôre going to go through some of the most common things we think about when we consider a healthier life:<br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-healthy-eating""><strong>1. Healthy eating</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This one is pretty obvious. We all know we should eat more vegetables, fruits, organic foods, and so on. The problem here is usually more practical: what kind of things should we buy, and how do we find the time to prepare them? Also,  to come up with a healthy menu every day?&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs try and make this easier for ourselves. First of all, what I did was to go on and look for healthy dishes with ingredients that I like to eat. From there, I wrote down a list of ingredients and the menu for the week. Also, I looked for meals that are easy to make, because I can‚Äôt spend hours in the kitchen cooking, no matter how much I enjoy it. Don‚Äôt forget that there‚Äôll be days when you won‚Äôt feel like cooking, so the easier, the better.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-exercise""><strong>2. Exercise</strong><br></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here we‚Äôll find a lot of options, depending on what you like to do, where you live and your budget. , because you don‚Äôt need to pay anything to do it. If you have a park close to your home, you can use it for exercising, or if you use the metro or the bus to come and go from work or school, you can always get off a few stops early and walk the rest of the way home.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If walking is not your favorite thing, you can try a gym close to your house, work or school. I find it better to go to the gym when I‚Äôm already doing something outside of the house so that I can keep the flow going. If you can‚Äôt go to the gym for any reason, technology is on our side! There are so many exercise apps to choose from. And the nice thing about the apps is that you can keep track of what you‚Äôre doing and share your progress with other members. Doing things as a group can bring the extra incentive we need to commit.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h3 id=""h-3-meditation""><strong>3. Meditation</strong><br></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is my favorite! Like with exercising and eating better, you need to reflect upon your routine and find the best time to fit in your meditation. Everybody says mornings are the best time to meditate, but the truth is that the best time to meditate is when you yourself have time. If you‚Äôre not a morning person, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with meditating at night. If you come home from school and have the afternoon free, then that may be the best time for you. The most important thing is to choose the time that suits you best.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once you find a good time in your schedule, try to meditate at the same time every day. This will help you get the new habit going, and it will help you maintain it. Consistency is also very important with meditation, much more than how long you spend practicing. If you‚Äôre new to meditation, just start with five minutes every day. Consistency is what will give you results, and after you experience those results, you‚Äôll naturally want to meditate for a longer period of time.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Did you write down your goals and why you want to reach them? If you haven‚Äôt, stop what you‚Äôre doing and make your list. It‚Äôs very important and helpful to think about these goals, and to look at your list every time you feel discouraged or like you don‚Äôt have enough time. It‚Äôs easier to keep ourselves on track when you clearly know what we want and what we need. For instance, I‚Äôve been meaning to build muscle for a long time, but I never really had a strong reason. Now, though, I have back problems, so I know why I‚Äôm going to the gym every day and what it costs me to just not go. , but my priorities have shifted. That‚Äôs what you need to discover for yourself: What‚Äôs important to you? What will you choose to prioritize?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now it‚Äôs your turn to share with us your story and the things you want. Do you know what kind of things block you? Or do you have suggestions? Let‚Äôs keep this conversation going in the comments!</p>

What brings certain people to believe that they should never be happy? Is it possible that we don‚Äôt know where to look for happiness? And how can we accept happiness in our lives in a healthy manner? These are the questions that we will attempt to answer in this article.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In a time when it seems like everyone is , it‚Äôs hard to imagine that some people actually forbid themselves from being happy. Even though this idea seems to go against our nature, it is much more common than one might realize. Often, this practice of refusing happiness is such a deep-rooted mechanism that those who experience it are unaware of it. So then, we can wonder, what can push someone to forbid themselves from being happy? Following are three scenarios frequently seen in people who have hard time being happy:<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-thinking-they-don-t-deserve-happiness""><strong>Thinking they don‚Äôt deserve happiness</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Some people are certain that they don‚Äôt deserve to be happy. This type of belief can come from different situations: a lack of love and affection in childhood, a feeling of not coming from the right social background or a heavy feeling of guilt that comes from a specific event‚Ä¶ No matter why someone believes this, the results are really similar: Often these people act in a way that confirms that they don‚Äôt deserve happiness. Subconsciously, they look for situations that prove that they correct in their belief, such as choosing impossible  or jobs that are not a good fit. They find themselves stuck in a cycle that they subconsciously created and that keeps confirming that they don‚Äôt deserve happiness.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">People with an extremely  usually fit this mold. It makes them act in such a way that forces others to consider and notice them ‚Äì both positively and negatively ‚Äì rather than for their own good. They can do that in different ways: some people will complain about their problems to whoever wants to listen, others will make everyone laugh even while in a depressive state‚Ä¶However they choose to bring attention to themselves, they give themselves a role that makes them feel seen even if it is to the detriment of their own happiness.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-choosing-normality-rather-than-happiness""><strong>Choosing ‚Äúnormality‚Äù rather than happiness</strong><br></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This way of behaving is very common and a reality for a high number of people. Because , it can be very difficult to come to terms with the fact that we may have tastes or wants that are ‚Äúdifferent‚Äô or ‚Äúout of the ordinary‚Äù from others‚Äô. We often decide to follow trends and imitate others rather than to assume our unique personality, even when it leaves us unhappy. This technique of auto-inclusion can start at an early age. In school, for example, children will pretend to like the same cartoons or games as their peers even when it is not the case.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In adults, this harmful behavior can take many forms. It can lead us, for example, to follow a career path that we are not really interested in, to spend time with people we don‚Äôt really have anything in common with, or to reject our sexual preference. These behaviors can, once again, lead people to feel unhappy, or even depressed.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-so-how-can-we-better-welcome-happiness""><strong>So, how can we better welcome happiness?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Thankfully, ending these harmful patterns&nbsp; and finally welcoming happiness in our lives is absolutely possible. Of course, the first step is to be conscious of the root of these mechanisms. Do they come from our childhood? It is possible that we may have been brought up in an environment that was excessively strict, tense or devoid of love. A painful childhood can lead people to believe that happiness is unattainable. Do they come from the social environment we live in? Sometimes, it is the context in which we operate that has very limiting and negative beliefs, such as, ‚ÄúYou have to work until you suffer, if necessary, to build your happiness‚Äù. Being aware of these mental constructs is the only way to really get rid of them.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most paradoxical keys to true happiness is the acceptance of suffering. We would love to only feel positive emotions, but it is not the reality of our existence. In trying to run away from difficult emotions, we also run away from positive emotions because we ignore a big part of ourselves that is essential to who we are. Our real capacity to be happy, therefore, depends on our ability to accept and welcome the whole range of our emotions.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Finally, it is important to understand that happiness is a choice. It is not a consequence of external factors, such as our social sphere or the sum of the events that pave our way. Believing such things can make us stay unhappy since it implies that we don‚Äôt have a choice whether to find happiness or not. Yet, the only true source of happiness comes from within and can only be nurtured by us. It‚Äôs by taking responsibility for our own happiness that we can give it a place in our lives.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In conclusion, to be happy, don‚Äôt hesitate to make decisions that suit you, become aware of your limiting beliefs so you can get rid of them and make the conscious decision to lead a happy life! And remember: by being yourself, you give others around you the amazing gift of allowing them to do the same.&nbsp; Before leaving, tell us in the comments: what do you think you can do to give more room for happiness to grow in your life?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The human journey is like a beautiful tapestry; our individual stories comprised of countless threads, woven together to create the whole of our experience. From the front, we see a colorful, vibrant work of art. From the back, we see it‚Äôs imperfections‚Äìfrayed pieces, overlapping threads, knots holding it together, mistakes hidden from the eye of the observer. To me, it‚Äôs the perfect analogy for the masterpiece of our lives, each with both good days and bad, joys and sorrows, peace of mind and heaviness of heart. We need the tangled stitches as much as the perfectly placed threads to bring shape, meaning, and structure to our work of art. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all prefer when things are working in our favor, but an essential part of life mastery is learning to ride the storms‚Äìstaying calm and anchored amidst the chaos. When life disrupts our peace of mind and presents us with challenges, as it inevitably will,&nbsp; there is always a tendency to turn our backs in resistance.  are unpleasantries that nobody wants to feel, so rather than face the stress and anxiety they may cause, we often push them away in the hopes they‚Äôll disappear. The problem is that when we resist, we come into conflict with our present moment reality, and we actually give these feelings power.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The road to peace begins when we can face these feelings, allowing them to rise and fall, to come and go, all without the need to control. If we can approach them, even in the most difficult of circumstances, with a willingness to be with our experience, in total acceptance of what is, we open a possibility of landing peacefully in the present moment of our lives. In other words, we must continue to weave with patience and resilience, trusting in the bigger picture.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-realize-your-emotions""><strong>Realize Your Emotions</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Acceptance isn‚Äôt about resignation. Quite the contrary, it is active and engaged. It doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt desire for our experience to be different in the near future. It simply means that we‚Äôre acknowledging our state of being in the here-and-now. When we accept‚Äìwhen we can admit that we are scared, anxious, overwhelmed‚Äìwe give voice to our difficult feelings. Creating space for them to rise to the surface in their full expression, with bravery and honesty,&nbsp; is the first step in allowing them to move through us. Where there is movement, there is the hope of liberation. Releasing our grip on these feelings is an empowering experience because it enables us to become less identified with them. It shows us an unwavering stability beneath the fluctuations of our minds, a distance , that can be very grounding during times of stress.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-realize-your-inner-source""><strong>Realize your Inner Source</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Developing reliable practices that nurture us during moments of internal conflict is essential for self-care. When I sense myself spiraling and know I need to prioritize my own support, I find a quiet place and I take refuge in the breath. It needn‚Äôt be anywhere special. Stress and anxiety don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs convenient to show up. Your sanctuary can be an airport bathroom, in your car on the side of the highway, or behind the locked door in your bedroom, away from .&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-practice""><strong>The Practice</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">1) With no sense of urgency, settle into a comfortable seat or lay down on my back. Close your eyes, arrive in your body, and settle in with a mindful check-in. Notice what your feeling and what is in your awareness. Remind yourself to give complete permission to be exactly where you are, to relinquish a bit of control and let go of the desire for things to be different.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">2) Place your&nbsp;right hand on your belly, the left over your heart, and .&nbsp; At first, simply observe. Watch the speed, depth, and rhythm. Notice where the breath is prominent (perhaps the nose or chest). Then, slowly shift to nasal breathing, and allow it to expand with ease throughout your torso. Feel the breath lift the ribs and belly to meet your hands on the inhale and soften on the exhale. Feel the air fill out your side and back body on the inhales. Let the body get heavy and soft on the exhales. Spend several minutes riding the waves of full-body breaths, allowing the rocking sensation to comfort you.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">3) Staying mindful of the movement of breath, take a moment to reflect on what wants to be expressed. Check in with the source of your internal conflict, and notice if there is something your resisting and how this is disturbing your inner peace. Give space for the full expression of your feelings, thoughts,&nbsp; . Notice how this shows up in your body and stay present with the sensations. Allow for intensity as they arise on the inhales, and watch them slowly dissipate with every exhale. Continue this practice of watching them rise and fall with complete acceptance. Rather than ‚Äúletting them go‚Äù, simply ‚Äúlet them be‚Äù <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">4) Once the mind has become quiet, invite stillness and spaciousness in your inner landscape. Imagine a state of mind, where, at any moment,&nbsp; you can easily access a reservoir of . An environment where a sense of calm flows naturally and which you can return to quickly when you fall from center. Allow this feeling to flood the body and get lost in waves of relaxation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">5) When you feel ready, gradually, transition awareness back to the breath‚Äìdeep inhales and complete exhales through the nose. Bring focus to your heart space, offering yourself .&nbsp; Once again, feel the hands rising and falling with the movement of the breath. Feeling held and supported and acknowledged. As you end your meditation, open the eyes.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">May this practice be a source of mental support and lead you back to moments of rest and ease. Please let us know if you‚Äôve found it help useful.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It might sound a little strange to read the words ‚Äúsex‚Äù and ‚Äú‚Äù in the same sentence. I don‚Äôt know about you, but when I think about meditation, the image that comes to my mind is of monks, or people sitting in the lotus position. Their faces are serene, and their breath is soft and calm ‚Äî not remotely the picture I have in mind when it comes to sex. If we dig a little deeper, though, we can see the connection, which is namely one thing leading to the improvement of the other. Think about this for a minute: when is sex really good? When we‚Äôre relaxed. When do we not feel like having sex? When we are stressed out.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With that in mind, how can meditation help our sex lives?<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-pleasure-stress""><strong>Pleasure &amp; Stress</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sentient beings look for the happiness and try to avoid suffering. This is one of the most basic universal concepts and one that unites us all. Pleasure is one of the ways we express our happiness or how we are able to feel this happiness we seek. We can feel pleasure in many ways, especially sensual pleasures that come from eating, drinking, being warm, getting a massage and obviously, from sex.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Whether we have a husband or a wife, a one night stand, or just masturbation, we express our need for pleasure or connection in one way or another. That‚Äôs because having an orgasm releases all sorts of chemicals in our brains and makes us feel happy and fulfilled. The catch here is that, for this to happen, we need to be relaxed, rested and at the moment. We all know that on some level ‚Äî we have never had a great night with someone who‚Äôs distracted, who was not paying attention, or who was not enjoying the moment. That‚Äôs true for us too. If we  and be in the moment, the night will not be pleasurable.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We know that meditation is the key to feeling that sense of rest and relaxation due to studies by physicians like Herbert Benson. His research showed that lower levels of cortisol and the activation of our parasympathetic nervous system are the keys to the relaxation responses in our body ‚Äî and both of those things can be achieved through meditation, allowing us to reach a more calm state that can benefit us in multiple areas of our lives.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-can-we-do""><strong>What Can We Do?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We know that meditation can help us lower our anxiety levels as well as  and attentive to our emotions and the people around us. Let‚Äôs see exactly how meditation can also make our lives better in the bedroom.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-and-being-rested""><strong>Meditation and Being Rested</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all lead challenging and sometimes chaotic lives. We rush around to keep up with work, studying, taking care of our families, or ourselves, all the while checking our phones every five minutes ‚Äî so, it‚Äôs no wonder we‚Äôre always so tired. We don‚Äôt sleep well, we don‚Äôt get enough rest, we‚Äôre stressed out, and we feel guilty because we can‚Äôt do it all by ourselves. Well, the truth is that we can‚Äôt do it all, but the first thing we should do is take care of ourselves. Meditating gives us the rest that our mind and body need, allowing us to replenish .</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">High stress means higher levels of cortisol in our bodies, which also translates to no orgasms for women and erectile dysfunction for men. Think about yourself: how high is your libido when you‚Äôre  about something? Not very high, I‚Äôd guess. Meditating helps us keep our cortisol and adrenaline low, and what‚Äôs more, it helps us to naturally produce more dopamine and serotonin, both known as the chemicals of bliss.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-being-mindful-being-present""><strong>Being mindful, being present</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mindful meditation is all about being present in the moment. Now, we all know that‚Äôs easier said than done, but that‚Äôs exactly why we practice. We are not going to become monks or experts overnight, but nonetheless, with time, we can become more aware, focused and present. This awareness, this presence, can do wonders for  as well because sex is about understanding what we feel and what our bodies respond to, as well as paying attention to our partners and their reactions.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, how about adding meditation to the list of how you can make your romantic life even better? Lighting candles, having a nice dinner and talking are all aphrodisiacs we can use to give our sex lives a boost. They are well and good, but they are also outside ourselves, and we all know that it‚Äôs how we feel inside that defines how happy we are and will be. With this in mind, don‚Äôt miss out on the benefits of meditating when it comes to . Tell us if this makes sense to you and if you see any difference in your sex life after beginning meditation.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-is-hygge""><strong>What is hygge?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The origins of  (pronounced hoo-guh) are little known and the word has no direct translation in other languages, but that poses no problem because hygge is not something that needs to be understood, but experienced.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">More than indulging in tangible things, hygge is first and foremost a feeling of comfort, coziness and peace. The main focus is on , experiencing a sense of belonging, and creating an atmosphere in which we feel safe and comfortable, where we can let our guard down and truly be ourselves, both alone and in the company of others. This could take many forms: going for leisurely walks in nature, being at home bundled up with a cup of hot chocolate in hand while it rains or snows outside, enjoying a moment of silence as we become hypnotized by the slow crackling of wood in a chimney, making dinner with the people we love or watching a film in bed while wearing the warmest and most comfortable pants you own and that you‚Äôd never dare to be seen in public with (the Danish also have a name for these kinds of pants: ‚Äúhyggebuckser‚Äù). Hygge is the practice of comforting our souls, and while it can be practiced all year long, it truly becomes a warm light in the coldest and darkest season of the year.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-tis-the-hygge-season""><strong>‚ÄòTis the hygge season</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The Winter Solstice in the Northern Hemisphere marks the beginning of winter, and it‚Äôs also the day with the fewest hours of sunlight in the whole year. If you live in a country where temperatures drop substantially during this time, then you know what a shock this change can be to our system. The cold temperatures and the absence of light for many months can really affect one‚Äôs mood and this can be particularly hard on people suffering from , a recognized psychological condition in which people experience symptoms of depression in the winter.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-hygge-contributes-to-your-wellbeing""><strong>Hygge contributes to your wellbeing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Despite the horrible weather and high taxes, for the past six years, Denmark has been in the top five happiest countries in the world, and researchers have taken an interest in knowing why this is so. Although to have a comprehensive answer one must take several factors into account ‚Äî including the welfare model Denmark has adopted ‚Äî Danish researchers at  in Copenhagen have found that most Danes attribute their state of happiness in great part to their hygge-focused lifestyle: hygge home decor, hygge clothes, hygge restaurants, hygge bakeries and even hygge laundromats!<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The science behind hygge is fairly simple. When we create a warm, safe and peaceful atmosphere to enjoy the good things in life with our loved ones, our bodies enter a state of calm which activates the  (PSN). The PSN is responsible for the body‚Äôs rest and digestive responses, and it decreases heart rate and helps our muscles relax. In other words, when the PSN is active, our bodies have time to heal themselves and feel well.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Practicing hygge contributes to less depression, stress and anxiety, and an increased sense of optimism, self-worth,  and gratitude. And because hygge puts an emphasis on nurturing relationships and building connections with others, this creates a sense of belonging that also has social benefits such as increased trust and intimacy, openness to practicing vulnerability with others and less reliance on social media.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-hygge-for-a-cozy-winter""><strong>Hygge for a cozy winter</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You don‚Äôt have to be Danish to incorporate hygge into your life, but there are certain steps to do it correctly. Implementing the following during winter will bring you feelings of peace, connection and comfort. So long winter blues!<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-lighting""><strong>1. Lighting.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The dimmer and warmer the lighting is, the more ‚Äúhyggeligt‚Äù the atmosphere becomes. The Danish favor lighting at the scale of 1800K; a sunset, a fire in a hearth, and candle flames are around this level of warmth. A good hygge lighting hack for your living room is to place a floor lamp with soft and warm light next to the couch or on a corner ‚Äî the Danish view bright ceiling lamps as torture devices for the eyes.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-start-doing-hygge-from-the-moment-you-wake-up""><strong>2. Start doing hygge from the moment you wake up.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many people insist on the fact that the way you start your morning sets the tone for the rest of the day, so why not infuse it with hygge from the moment you wake up? One of my favorite ways to do this is by lighting candles all over my bedroom when I get out of bed. Not only does this create a very zen atmosphere, it also helps my eyes slowly and softly adjust to the light of the day. This is followed by the Ayurvedic recommendation of a cup of warm water with a few drops of fresh lemon, and I do so while wearing warm clothes and many times while in bed! The whole world can surely wait until I am done with these moments of warmth, peace and comfort. (Do make sure to air out the places where you lit the candles when you‚Äôre done.)<br></p>

   <h3 id=""h-3-togetherness-pleasure-comfort""><strong>3. Togetherness, pleasure &amp; comfort.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When the weather gets really cold, we might be more reluctant to spend time outside, especially at night. Hygge has you covered! Invite your friends over for an evening of togetherness, pleasure and comfort! The point of this is that everyone feels comfortable in their skin, literally and figuratively. Ask everyone to dress comfortably, light candles in the living room, cook or bake together, make mulled wine or some other non-alcoholic drink and sip it over a drama-free chat or a fun board game. Nobody needs to be at the center of attention and prove their worthiness (everyone loves each other already!),  and give everyone time to speak and listen. Repeat these sessions as often as possible.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-4-practice-mindfulness-gratitude-harmony""><strong>4. Practice mindfulness, gratitude &amp; harmony.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The word solstice comes from the Latin ‚Äúsol,‚Äù which means sun, and ‚Äúsistere,‚Äù which means to stand still. Winter gives us the opportunity to rest and turn our attention inward, so this is the perfect time to practice  for the good and simple things we have in our lives. No matter how short, take a moment every day to turn off all your devices and take your attention inward, try to tap into your current feelings of safety and warmth and give thanks for that. When you‚Äôre with your loved ones, appreciate their presence and maintain a kind attitude towards those around you, feel gratitude for the moments you get to spend in the company of these amazing human beings.<br></p>

Give yourself permission to do nothing and fully enjoy it!<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Hygge has helped me embrace and even enjoy winter time. I hope it does the same for you!<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôre like me or most people, you have probably experienced difficulty sleeping. You may not experience problems all the time ‚Äî sleep issues may only happen for you now and again, such as during periods of stress. I recently started researching how to sleep better, in part because I‚Äôve moved so much in the last few years that sometimes I wake up and don‚Äôt know exactly where I am. As a freelancer, sometimes my schedule can be hectic, and this adds an extra layer to sleep issues as well. I invite you to join me in this article in which I try to understand myths about sleeping, whether what‚Äôs considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù is really normal and whether that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kind of sleep really works for everyone.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-normal-sleep""><strong>‚ÄúNormal‚Äù sleep</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sleep, anyway? We‚Äôre all very concerned about being ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù and we can sometimes feel left out when we have habits that are perceived to be different than that norm. But normality is just as much a social construct as it is a biological one, so let‚Äôs reflect a little on our idea of what‚Äôs normal when it comes to sleep.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-consecutive-eight-hour-sleep""><strong>The consecutive eight-hour sleep</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We read everywhere that sleeping well is good for our health and productivity, and that we should get at least eight hours every night. However, no one really knows how this concept was developed or why. Historical records reveal that people used to sleep in two blocks referred to then as the ‚Äúfirst sleep‚Äù and the ‚Äúsecond sleep.‚Äù The first sleep would take place after dusk. After that sleep, one would wake up for a few hours in the middle of the night, then the second sleep would be until morning. Between these two blocks, people would stay in bed to read or pray. Some would get up, smoke or even take a walk. It was so normal that doctors would recommend to couples trying to conceive that they have sex after the first sleep. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By the late 1600s, records about first and second sleep had all but disappeared. This disappearance of the two-block sleep pattern can be attributed to electricity and better infrastructure, which allowed for us to have an actual nightlife, such as having dinner later, going out for coffee or to bars. The historian Craig Koslofsky explains this shift in his book <em>Evening‚Äôs Empire</em>, writing that before the invention of street lighting, the night was reserved for criminals, sex workers, and drunks. In 1667, Paris was the first city to have lights on the streets, followed by Lile and Amsterdam. Being awake in the night became fashionable and going to bed early started to be seen as a waste of time. This notion only became more common after the Industrial Revolution.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-productivity-and-the-eight-hour-sleep""><strong>Productivity and the eight-hour sleep</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The emphasis on sleeping better so that you can become more productive is all well and good‚Ä¶ until you get stressed out when you can‚Äôt sleep the eight hours you were supposed to. What we should do, then, is reflect on how much the preoccupation about sleeping a certain amount of time is actually important and makes a difference in our lives versus how much it is a cultural and economic-based construct. We all have ideas about what ‚Äúbeing normal‚Äù means, and the energy we spend trying to fit in might be the exact thing that‚Äôs keeping us awake at night.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When it comes to productivity and sleep, there are some things to consider. For one, napping has been phased out of the Western culture in the same way as the two-block sleep has. The Spanish, for example, had their traditional nap banished from public offices in 2006, and in the same vein, in Japan, you can hardly find nap spaces in offices anymore. All of this has occurred due to the change in ideas about work ethic: these days, time spent sleeping is seen as a waste of money. On the other hand, some consultancies argue in favor of napping to increase productivity. Companies like Pepsi and IBM have tried introducing sleeping pods in the workplace. However, that didn‚Äôt increase productivity because not everyone is able to relax enough to take a nap during the day at the office ‚Äî especially when we live in a technological age with so many things to distract us. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-s-normal-for-you""><strong>What‚Äôs normal for you?&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I come from a very traditional family with traditional sleeping habits and ‚Äúnormal jobs,‚Äù so when I started freelancing it was hard for me to adapt. I have a completely different schedule, and it took me some time to understand that my ‚Äúnormal‚Äù wasn‚Äôt the normal I grew up with. I had to rethink my routines as well as my mindset. I choose a different way to work, live and sleep, but that doesn‚Äôt mean I now work any less, or that I‚Äôm lazy. What I‚Äôm trying to show with this example from my life is that we sometimes get caught up in certain ideas, and most of them weren‚Äôt created by us or work for us.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, the most important point here is not exactly the sleeping part, but that it‚Äôs important to reflect on your own ideas about sleep. Are those ideas really your own beliefs about sleep? Have friends, family, and ideas in the media perhaps influenced your idea of what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sleep patterns are? We should all reflect on these questions and our own mindset because we are all different and all have different needs. We need to figure out what works best for us. If this happens to be eight hours of sleep, that‚Äôs okay, just as it‚Äôs okay if you sleep in blocks, for less than eight hours, or by taking a nap in the afternoon. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs start a conversation in the comments below. How much sleep do you need? If you have a non-traditional schedule, how do you plan your sleeping routine?<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever found yourself having difficulty saying the things that need to be said? Life is , whether it‚Äôs a small everyday disagreement or an emotional discussion. Conflicts occur because we are all different: We like different things, we have different ways of viewing the world, and we have different habits. In the end, we‚Äôd all prefer to have it our own way if at all possible. But differences are natural, and navigating them can actually make us grow and learn. With that being said, why are some of us afraid of conflict?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For one, we might fear that if we express what we want, we might lose opportunities, or  and their affection. Avoiding conflict may alleviate our anxiety in the moment, but in the long run, it has the opposite effect ‚Äî it reinforces our habit of not expressing ourselves and not saying what needs to be said. This avoidance is the best way to not get the life we want. Expressing ourselves and confronting differences head-on is very simple, but unfortunately it is not easy.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-can-we-overcome-this-fear""><strong>How can we overcome this fear?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The fear of conflict can permeate every aspect of our lives. We may be afraid to , whether about a problem in the office or to ask for a raise or promotion, because we may fear losing our job. In our love lives, we may be scared of losing our partner‚Äôs affection. This may be the same for conflict with family or friends. We should keep in mind, though, that expressing what we need is not a bad thing, and encountering conflict does not necessarily mean that you will lose something. How we express ourselves counts for a lot ‚Äî if we say what we‚Äôre thinking with love and respect for the other person, we can potentially adjust relationships and situations without having to lose something in the process.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-acknowledge-and-observe""><strong>Acknowledge and observe</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôre reading this article, you‚Äôre probably on a , and that‚Äôs crucial. We have all had different lives and upbringings. Even if we have the same difficulties as others, those issues will have different roots for each of us. It‚Äôs important to understand the causes of our behavior so we can obtain the tools to overcome them. A large part of this process is to not avoid our feelings, and acknowledge them instead. Observing them is the next step so that we can recognize how our emotions appear and thus we can try not to be as reactive to our feelings in situations of conflict.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever noticed yourself experiencing the same problems with different people? Do some situations keep repeating themselves in your life? Well, I have noticed this. I feel like whenever I don‚Äôt understand something or I don‚Äôt know how to deal with a situation, it keeps coming back. The first step in addressing these recurring scenarios is to understand that the problem might not be the other person ‚Äî they can be just activating pre-existing patterns of behavior in ourselves. When we acknowledge and observe, we start to see and understand these patterns in our lives and see that they are more about situations and context than they are about people. When we stop , we look for our own patterns of thought and behavior, and things get more clear. We have more distance that we can use to find a solution from within ourselves.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Life is full of many wonderful experiences. Oftentimes, a highlight amongst them, is the experience of marriage. As most people begin their new journey  of their lives, they hardly give any thought to the idea of what could possibly go wrong. However, the pain of divorce is a reality that many couples are faced with along the way.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">can be one of the most challenging life experiences a person can go through. Even if you‚Äôre the partner who took the initiative to end the marriage, is very unlikely to move through separation without feeling a range of very challenging emotions. After all, you created an entire life rhythm with someone we loved. Reliable routines, habits, and lifestyle choices are hard to change.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-acknowledging-your-emotions""><strong>Acknowledging your emotions</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this period, it‚Äôs not uncommon to have contradictory feelings and all sorts of emotions. You can wake up feeling relieved and empty at the same time. It‚Äôs important to acknowledge their wide range, without guilt for the ebbing and flowing from one to the next. With any big change, a sense of confusion is normal.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-blame""><strong>Blame </strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the first things we do is try to assign blame. Blaming yourself or blaming your ex can happen and it‚Äôs normal to think about what went wrong. It‚Äôs important , though, where these thoughts are coming from and deal with them. We all know that there is always two sides to every story, so it‚Äôs helpful to see all perspectives, even if, in the end, you don‚Äôt agree.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-mourn""><strong>Mourn</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Even if you weren‚Äôt , you need to mourn the end of it. You both agreed to spend your lives together, and this is one of the deepest types of intimacy two people can share. So, it‚Äôs very normal to feel a painful and uncomfortable void in your life.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-some-suggestions-to-help-you-deal-with-this-phase""><strong>Some suggestions to help you deal with this phase</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Acknowledging your emotions is the first step of this process, but you can‚Äôt stop there. It‚Äôs necessary to deal with them. Keep in mind, though, that everyone is different and you should do what feels most adequate to you and in your own time.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-talking-about-it""><strong>Talking about it </strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Along with the process of mourning the end of your marriage, talking is very important. You‚Äôll have a rush of feelings and it helps to have someone to talk through them.&nbsp;</p>

   <h3 id=""h-therapy""><strong>Therapy</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Even though friends are essential, it can feel satisfying to be able to talk, without any kind of filter, about what you‚Äôre feeling. A professional can also facilitate sessions that address the right kinds of questions and finding your own path moving forward.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-meditate""><strong>Meditate</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Give yourself time to stop and reflect upon everything that happened‚Äìhow you feel in the present moment and how you would like to feel at the end of the healing process. When we‚Äôre in long-term relationships, it‚Äôs common to lose ourselves, and the quiet will help you find yourself again.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-time""><strong>Time</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is important to emphasize time. There‚Äôs no right or wrong amount of time, when dealing with a divorce. Don‚Äôt rush yourself to be or to feel something that doesn‚Äôt feel aligned.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs very important to keep in mind that you‚Äôll feel like you‚Äôre on a roller-coaster of emotions. You won‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre currently feeling forever.&nbsp; Things will start to make sense again, at some point, and you will begin to feel like yourself. When the time comes (and it will come), you‚Äôll wake up and the pain will be gone. You won‚Äôt feel sad and your grief will be over, like it never happened. This will be the moment to look at yourself and rediscover who you are, the things that you love, and how you want your life to be from now on. It‚Äôs a little bit like looking at a blank canvas or a blank page ‚Äî you‚Äôll start to write your own story again.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Keep in mind that this‚Äôs an amazing opportunity, to start over fresh and chose your life moving forward. So, don‚Äôt waste any time: look at yourself and at your life with love, .&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You are the love of life, so make yourself the best company you can possibly be.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Winter is a time of stillness‚Äìa season when much of the natural world turns inward and gets quiet.&nbsp; Colder temperatures, coupled with shorter days and barren landscapes, have a way of silently urging us to turn down the volume and slow the pace of our lives.&nbsp; Our inner knowing tells us to root down, securing a sanctuary for sustenance and deep rest for the coming days.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this slow, dark, internal time in our seasonal cycle, it is natural to hold on tightly to ‚Äìconserving our energy for warmer months that hold the potential of growth, expansion, and activity. Like all animals on Earth, our human behavior is affected by changes in our environment and, if in tune with our bodies, we pay close attention to its cues.&nbsp; Honoring this receptive and nourishing time of year is part of living a mindful, balanced life. However, it‚Äôs important to notice when we might be veering off the path of deep listening and, instead, into unhealthy lethargy and stagnancy.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To prevent myself from getting entirely swallowed by my comfy abode in the thick of winter, I rely on the deep healing benefits of connecting with nature. It keeps me in  and continually nurtures me back to balance. Not only do I feel more vital in both mind and body when I prioritize this relationship, but I have the inner satisfaction of knowing I‚Äôm taking my wellbeing into my own hands.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here are some tips forin winter to ensure my well-being:<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-bundle-up-get-outside""><strong>Bundle Up &amp; Get Outside</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Put on some layers and brave the elements. Convincing ourselves to face the cold isn‚Äôt always easy. It‚Äôs not exactly a&nbsp; soul-soothing experience when our inclination is to stay cozy. The shock of the cold sends our nervous system into survival mode, which immediately sharpens our minds and bodies. Therefore, it takes a bit of will and the faith that it‚Äôs rewards will be worth it.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Aside from the simple pleasure of experiencing familiar places with fresh eyes and opening all of our sensory channels to take in the beauty of the changing landscape, just a few minutes a day outdoors offers a host of health benefits. It has been proven to improve our moods, reduce stress, and increase .<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A simple 15-minute walk in the cold, crisp winter air‚Äìto take deep breaths and pay attention to the sounds of nature‚Äì can have a dramatic effect on your day. Try catching the brilliant color palette of a sunrise or sunset~adding color and inspiration to the, often, drab winter landscape. Or enjoy some night-time stargazing. Constellations move across the night sky from season to season. Some, such as Orion and Pleiades, are more visible in the northern hemisphere during winter, for instance.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-bring-nature-indoors""><strong>Bring Nature Indoors</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To fully embrace nature‚Äôs healing power, it‚Äôs always best to <em>actually</em> get outdoors whenever possible. However, bringing elements of it inside is the second-best idea. One of the most common ways is to fill your living space with houseplants (as well as bring your outdoor potted plants in for the winter). If you‚Äôre like me, placing plants around the home brings an immediate sense of peace and harmony. Not only do they enliven our spaces with their beauty, freshness, and pops of color, but they allow us to plug back into a relationship with nature when we choose to care for them. <br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-grow-something""><strong>Grow Something</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another way to stay connected to nature‚Äôs rhythm in winter is to get your hands in the dirt.&nbsp; Repot those house plants. Create a succulent garden or terrarium. Grow something from seed for fun. Consider planting a culinary herb garden in a sunny kitchen window. Nothing feels more nature-aligned than growing, ourselves, what we put into our bodies. Dill, thyme, oregano, chives, sage, and rosemary are a few easy-to-grow options that are  (and second as an aromatic experience to lift the mood). </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-cook-seasonally""><strong>Cook Seasonally</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Cooking seasonally simply means that you eat what‚Äôs grown locally and what‚Äôs in-season. Eating with the cycles of nature connects us to the land and its harvest. Not only does it taste better from having time to fully ripen, it also promotes balance with the earth‚Äôs resources, and supports better health with more nutrient-dense food. As nature would have it, most places have a bounty of winter-grown foods, such as delicious fruit and hearty vegetables that you can incorporate into your diet during the colder months to match your seasonal needs.&nbsp; </p>

   <h2 id=""h-take-advantage-of-natural-light""><strong>Take Advantage of Natural Light</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The human body depends upon daily exposure to natural light to boost our energy, mood, and metabolism. During winter, when we spend more time indoors with artificial lighting, our bodies do not receive the natural cues it needs to maintain our healthy circadian rhythms. This influences our sleep-wake cycles, digestion,, hormone release, body temperature, and other important bodily functions.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Spend time in brightly-lit spaces during the early hours of your day.&nbsp; Keep your curtains open, clear the window sills, and make these spaces inviting by arranging furniture to sit in sunlit spaces. Try placing a bird feeder outside a sunny window for some window-gazing. Watching the birds in the sunlight, learning to identify them and their unique songs, can give us a positive sense of enduring life.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-limit-screen-time""><strong>Limit Screen Time</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When the winter season keeps us indoors, it becomes quite easy to default to excessive screen time for entertainment (television and video games) and .&nbsp; While satisfying and effective in small doses, it can also lead to a sense of disconnection‚Äìfrom our ourselves, each other, and our environment. Get creative. Winter is the perfect time to savor the little live‚Äôs small treasures that can get overlooked when life speeds up again‚Äìgame night with loved ones, good reads, art projects, and new recipes.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Enjoy your winter. Let us know if you enjoy these tips.</p>

Perfectionism: Not as Perfect as You'd Think üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <h1><strong>Perfectionism&nbsp;</strong></h1> 
   <p>Have you ever been called a perfectionist? Do you have a boss, spouse, parent or friend who is a perfectionist? We might define perfectionism as being pedantic, having a generally disapproving attitude, or subscribing to ‚Äúall-or-nothing‚Äù thinking. This definition is both right and wrong. These are the characteristics of those who seek and aim for perfectionism. However, unfortunately perfectionism can be hidden deep down in the secret corners of one‚Äôs personality. When perfectionism manifests itself like this, it can sneakily cause behavioral patterns that make life difficult and cause problems.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>The Mind of a Perfectionist&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>I say ‚Äúsneakily‚Äù because in general, we tend to consider people to be perfectionists if they set high standards in their business and private lives, or if they have very organized lives with very strict plans. When it comes to someone who we think of as ‚Äúaverage‚Äù or ‚Äúhumble‚Äù ‚Äî and this can even be ourselves ‚Äî we don‚Äôt categorize that person as a perfectionist. On the other hand, behind the lives of people who seem to be humble or disorganized on the outside, there can be a perfectionist mind on the inside. Some people who don‚Äôt feel like they are successful or fulfilled in their lives fall into this category knowingly or unknowingly. This is because sometimes we set such high expectations from ourselves or others that we can‚Äôt even take a step due to fear. We are scared we won‚Äôt achieve the high bar we have set for ourselves.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>For this reason, we can say that most people who tend to procrastinate are perfectionists. It‚Äôs never the right time to start, and it‚Äôs always tough to be completely ready. Moreover, our mind runs away from shoulds and shouldn‚Äôts that we impose on ourselves when it comes to working on a task. The responsibilities we assume involuntarily get heavier and heavier. As a result, we strengthen the perception that we can‚Äôt achieve anything and we‚Äôre insufficient.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Perfectionist can be related to seeking perfection. Everything should be perfect from houses we visit to the clothes of the people we meet. Even the smallest flaw in our lives is enough to make us feel uncomfortable and nervous. Despite planning the whole week perfectly, if one of the plans change, the world can turn upside down. It is very easy to be convinced that life is perfect or flawless ‚Äî because we tend to consider our own high expectations to just be normal. Another common aspect of perfectionism is the obsession with success: there is always a list of duties to accomplish and bullet points to tick. Perfectionism makes us think about things in terms of duties they need to accomplish, not individual tasks. That‚Äôs why, when you compliment someone who tends to be a perfectionist, the lackluster responses you get are generally because they truly do not believe they have accomplished anything, not because they are being modest.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Unfortunately, setting very high standards for anything in our lives can cause dissatisfaction and disappointment in the long run. The reason for this is the belief that these standards are normal and achievable. Even if you achieve goals that seem to be very difficult, and even if you have a very high status, there are still many more things to achieve. What‚Äôs more, the appreciation of other people never satisfies you. Rather than thinking that your goals are unrealistic, you believe that if you work hard enough, you can achieve anything. When you can‚Äôt achieve these goals, you start to blame yourself. Even if what you have achieved never seems sufficient, the feeling of development and progress keeps you going. You keep running towards a point which seems to be more definite. You believe that you will be relaxed and free when you achieve that final goal. The bad news is that this will never happen, because you will keep chasing after other goals. This is how perfectionism harms us, as there will always be other examples you‚Äôll compare yourself with, and who you think are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than you. When dissatisfaction and the feeling of inadequacy in fulfilling the goals we set become constant, the exhaustion starts.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2><strong>Realize What Your Mind Says&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>Do these sentences sound familiar to you?</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>‚ÄúNothing I‚Äôve done is good enough.‚Äù</li> 
    <li>‚ÄúI deserve to be criticized ‚Äî by myself, mostly ‚Äî when I make a mistake.‚Äù</li> 
    <li>‚ÄúWealth and social status are important for me.‚Äù</li> 
    <li>‚ÄúSometimes I push myself so hard that my relationships are affected, or I can‚Äôt spare time for them.‚Äù</li> 
    <li>‚ÄúThere are so many things that I need to do, so I don‚Äôt have time to relax and have fun.‚Äù</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>If so, maybe you‚Äôre in the comfort zone of being busy all the time. Sustaining a lifestyle or keeping doing something just to accomplish it without even remembering why we started it in the first place can turn into a pressure which creates anxiety. That pressure gets overwhelming. Your work-life balance is lost, and you may find yourself spending most of your time trying to plan and organize the things you‚Äôre supposed to do instead of actually doing them. This is generally when perfectionism starts to cause distress.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Additionally, these behavioral patterns cause physical ailments like intestinal problems, migraines, ulcers, colitis, skin problems, high blood pressure or arrhythmia. These can also become chronic over time.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>Some Mindfulness Exercises for Daily Life&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>Do you feel that, even if you push yourself a lot and do your best, some things in your life are slipping out of your control? Even though you work very hard, do you hear from your friends or family that you let them down? Does hearing these things make you feel even worse because you think that everything should be perfect, even in your relationships? Or to put it simply: do you often hear that you‚Äôre a perfectionist? If you find yourself saying these things to yourself, you can decrease the pressure and disappointment in your life with a few simple exercises:&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3><strong>1. Make a list of the pros and cons of being a perfectionist</strong></h3> 
   <p>What benefits do you get from keeping your expectations high and having a certain standard in your life? What do you sacrifice in return? Make a list and be honest with yourself. If you feel the need, ask for help from trusted friends or family. Writing this out and seeing it in front of you is a good mindfulness method.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3><strong>2. List the areas in which you feel difficulty in your life&nbsp;</strong></h3> 
   <p>These can be things that you say ‚ÄúNo matter what I do, I can‚Äôt achieve it,‚Äù or things that are not efficient. It can also be things that you do involuntarily just because you think you need to do them. Remember that this also includes relationships that actually don‚Äôt work, or people you keep seeing even if you don‚Äôt want to.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3><strong>3. Recognize your expectations in these areas and take notes</strong></h3> 
   <p>For these areas, write down your expectations from yourself and others. After that, be honest with yourself about whether they are realistic or not. Try to revise them accordingly.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>You can do these exercises until you feel that the pressure in your life decreases. What difficulties do you feel in your life? If you feel comfortable to do so, please share the results of these exercises with us in the comments.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-reciprocity-the-key-to-a-romantic-relationship-that-works""><strong>Reciprocity | The key to a romantic relationship that works</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What does it mean to reciprocate in a romantic relationship? Put simply, it means that whatever applies to one of the partners also applies to the other partner. Let‚Äôs look at an example of reciprocity, one that is often a source of conflict , using two fictional characters: Alex and Sasha.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Alex is an extremely jealous person who doesn‚Äôt allow Sasha to enjoy a drink with friends when he is not around. Because of this, Sasha never goes out in the evening unless Alex is with her. Sasha, however, is not jealous and doesn‚Äôt see any problem with Alex going out with his friends, as he pleases, regardless of the time of day or the type of activity that he and his friends engage.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is an example of a relationship where the  is obvious. In their relationship, what‚Äôs true for Alex is not true for Sasha. This example may seem extreme, but this type of situation is actually very common. Typical or not, it can be very harmful. In your romantic relationship, if you identify with Sasha, I invite you to ponder this question: Isn‚Äôt my freedom worth as much as the freedom of the person I love? Should I pay the price of his insecurities? If, conversely, you identify with Alex, take a moment to think about this: Doesn‚Äôt the person I love deserve to live a life independent of mine, to be happy and feel accomplished?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is only one example amongst many possible ways reciprocity can be compromised. The important thing is to understand is that we can‚Äôt expect from our partner what we are not willing to offer to them. The opposite is just as unfair, and this imbalance will, sooner or later, weaken the foundations of the romantic relationship.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-freedom-for-everyone-how-to-keep-a-romantic-relationship-balanced""><strong>Freedom for everyone | How to keep a romantic relationship balanced?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In any romantic relationship, we have to keep this formula in mind: 1+1=3. This means that in any relationship there are three distinct entities: a partner, the other partner, and the couple. We have a tendency to think about the ideal formula for a happy couple to look more like this 1+1=1. In this scenario, the two partners would merge together to become one. However, if we look at this closely, this formula has neither long term viability or health for either partner. It implies that each person gives up a part of their identity for the benefit of the couple in the name of love. Is this really desirable?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the formula I suggest, each partner has  and is respected as a full individual. 1+1=3 suggests that each partner‚Äôs personality, wants, and projects are valued, but, also, that the couple is its own entity. This description of a couple doesn‚Äôt minimize the importance of the romantic relationship‚Äìon the contrary. It doesn‚Äôt banish compromises either since they are also important to have in a balanced relationship. It simply valorizes equality and balance in the couple, so that each partner can feel fulfilled and flourish fully.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In short, each partner engaged in a healthyshould respect the choices and decisions of the other, as long as they are ethical, responsible, and fair. In the kind of relationships where each of the partners acts responsibly (i.e. doesn‚Äôt put their life or that of others in danger and doesn‚Äôt take undue risks), neither of the partners is in a position where they can ‚Äúauthorize‚Äù the other to do anything. Each of the partners should decide for themselves. To find balance in our relationships, it is then important to come out of the parent-child dynamic to find harmony between two adults who decide together to grow alongside each other.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-is-my-romantic-relationship-normal""><strong>Is my romantic relationship normal?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What does normal mean? This is a question that we see often and for good reason. In romantic relationships, as in life in general, there shouldn‚Äôt be standards that we follow. As we well know,  is made up of two individuals with different personalities and totally different pasts. Even if it is important to have laws telling us what is acceptable to say or do to another person, there is no right or wrong way to be together as long as each person and their happiness is being respected within the relationship.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For example, we commonly expect that a happy couple shares a bed. A couple who decides to sleep in separate beds without apparent reason is quickly judged as strange. To a lot of people, their union can be perceived as unhappy or unbalanced. However, there is nothing wrong with making these types of decisions, especially if it guarantees balance and long-lasting happiness. This applies to all the areas of a romantic relationship. Whether it be , communication styles, shared responsibilities or finances‚Ä¶each of us is free to build our relationships however we please. <br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For this reason, it is important to distinguish between the notion of a healthy or unhealthy relationship and whether a relationship follows the societal norms that we are used to. To say it simply: If you feel fulfilled by your relationship, if it makes you grow as a person and matches with who you are, how it is seen by others is irrelevant. However, if you feel like you aren‚Äôt being respected and free to act and make decisions in your romantic relationship or that you are no longer happy, it‚Äôs important that you ask yourself the right questions. You can, of course, use the points described in this article to determine which category your relationship falls into.

What Are You Afraid of? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs freedom to me? No fear!‚Äù ‚Äì Nina Simone</p> 
   <p>If you‚Äôre anything like me, you are afraid of something, and that fear keeps you from going after what you want. It may even stop you from leading the life you dream of. These fears are usually socially constructed, but realizing and knowing that doesn‚Äôt necessarily make them go away. We may have a fear that we‚Äôre not good enough, or we may believe that the things that we want are silly. We could be a little ashamed to admit the things we want, or we could be afraid of being judged for wanting those things. Or, we could not understand how something works and be too afraid to ask.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>It‚Äôs important to understand why we are afraid, but furthermore, it is crucial to try and get past this feeling because, although we are all unique in our own ways, we do have things in common with other people as well. Maybe we just haven‚Äôt found those commonalities yet. As we discuss here in the blog, finding those connections with other people is one of the most important things we can do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-am-i-afraid""><strong>Why am I afraid?</strong></h2> 
   <p>My therapist used to tell me all the time: ‚ÄúHow is that ‚Äòuncomfortable zone‚Äô working out for you?‚Äù What she was trying to put in my head was that the so-called ‚Äúcomfort zone‚Äù that I was so afraid to leave was actually pretty uncomfortable. I was only staying there because that was the misery I knew. Life has its ups and downs, things we like and things we want to improve, but sometimes we just stay in the same place because we are afraid. It‚Äôs as though we are living in a cage with open doors: instead of just leaving the cage, we decorate it.<br></p> 
   <p>If we were able to leave all of our fears behind, who would we turn out to be? I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs possible to be completely unafraid, but we can try to reduce our level of fear. I left my country three years ago and I‚Äôm now living in my sixth country and thirteenth city. I was also married twice and am now trying my third profession. On one hand, it might look like I don‚Äôt really know what I want ‚Äî sometimes, I really don‚Äôt. On the other hand, I also feel like I‚Äôm taking small steps to try and figure it out who it is I‚Äôm supposed to be.<br></p> 
   <p>I have to say that this process has not been so easy. I‚Äôve been confronted with many of my fears, and I still feel like I have a long way to go. I compare myself to other people who seem more ‚Äútogether,‚Äù who are more financially successful, or who have longer marriages than I did. Sometimes I feel old, and that makes things even harder. That happens every time I start to compare myself to others: I have to remind myself that we all have different lives, different upbringings and experiences, and we all make different choices and want different things.</p> 
   <p>I always wanted to have an interesting life, but I was stuck in a marriage where I wasn‚Äôt happy. I thought I stayed out of love, but really it was out of fear. I didn‚Äôt know if I could make it on my own in a different country without my family and friends. I didn‚Äôt know if my health would be stable enough, or if my anxiety problems would pull me down. I still don‚Äôt have all the answers: I still struggle to get the life that I want. I still feel very lonely and sometimes I miss that comfort zone. I know this is all about my fears, but still, it is not easy and I have to remind myself every day why I chose this life, and more importantly, why I keep choosing it every day.</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs freedom to me? No fear!‚Äù This quote by Nina Simone is one that I say to myself every time I feel like everything is too much or I feel like giving up. I‚Äôm able to repeat this and continue on because most of the time, I‚Äôm happy with my choices. I look at my life now and how it was two years ago, and I‚Äôm glad I made the choices I did. It‚Äôs not about everything being easy all the time, it‚Äôs about feeling and knowing that you‚Äôre doing what you‚Äôre supposed to be doing. It‚Äôs about being afraid, but doing something anyway until you‚Äôre not afraid anymore.</p>

   <p>It takes time and patience. More times than not, I feel it‚Äôs taking too long, or that I‚Äôm still afraid of many things, or that I should be braver. So I try to tell myself that this is a process, and I look for ways of making it a bit easier. Here are some thoughts on how to go through this process:&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Write down your choices. When we‚Äôre not in our ‚Äúuncomfortable zone,‚Äù it might be difficult to keep our heads up and not give up. So I write down again and again what is it that I want.<br></p> 
   <p>Write down the good things in your life. Maybe we‚Äôre not living the lives we want; that can make us sad and make us doubt our resolve. What I do is I write down everything I already achieved and appreciate all the good things that I already have.<br></p> 
   <p>Write down where you were last year and where you are now. Comparing ourselves with others can be very frustrating. We‚Äôre always going to find someone who‚Äôs more successful, younger, prettier‚Ä¶ so it might be best to just compare you with you. How was your life last year, six months ago, a month ago? Are you moving forward or are you stuck? This is a good way of keeping yourself in check and not allowing yourself to get back in that ‚Äúuncomfortable zone.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p>Write down where and who you want to be. It‚Äôs important to have goals. It doesn‚Äôt matter if they change over time because we ourselves are changing all the time ‚Äî so we might as well adjust our goals too. But it‚Äôs important to have them and to know what they are. The path is as important as the destination, but if you don‚Äôt have any idea of where you want to go, how will you appreciate the walk?<br></p> 
   <p>Meditate. Always meditate. It doesn‚Äôt have to be an hour every day; consistency is more important than quantity. And in any case, when we start to realize how much better things become after we get the hang of the practice, the tendency will be to practice longer. Meditation helps us to be present, to observe our emotions and reactions. It helps us with our anxiety, to keep us calm and soften our fears. We realize things will always change, and our fear starts to decrease.</p> 
   <p>We are all a work in progress, so I invite you to write your experiences in the comments below. Your experience can help someone, or just talking and writing about it can help you. What are your fears? What do you do to deal with them?<br></p>

Three Top Tips to Have an Enjoyable Christmas Holidays with No Stress üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Christmas is stressful. This seems to be an accepted fact.</p> 
   <p>But does it have to be this way?</p> 
   <p>On one hand, there is no doubt that Christmas has the potential to majorly trigger our stress response patterns, with the endless subtle media pressure to be happy around Christmas, the increased pressure on family dynamics and a desire to make sure we are making the most of what is supposed to be a very special time of year. Yet really we are the ones in control. Although outside pressures can make it more difficult to reduce our stress levels, practical tips can significantly support us in making Christmas Holidays much more enjoyable and even stress-free. The power is within and not in what is happening on the outside.</p> 
   <p>This sounds great, yet what practical techniques are there to start to cultivate the power within to help us reduce stress around Christmas?</p> 
   <p>Firstly we need to learn not to take all the expectations around Christmas so seriously, realising a lot of it just causes us not to enjoy it and adds a whole load of stress that simply shouldn‚Äôt be there. What expectations do you have around Christmas? Obviously, a lot of it depends on our unique circumstances and sub-conscious conditioning, but generally, we feel the pressure to be happy, to make others happy and to build up to this one monumental day that should be one of the highlights of the year. That is a whole load of pressure to be putting on yourself.</p> 
   <p>There is another way.</p> 
   <p>Rather than going along with all the expectation the best thing to do for an enjoyable Christmas Holidays that is stress-free is to try and see the imperfection in perfection. All will be fine. There will be ups and downs, great memorable moments and boring forgettable moments, agreements and disagreements, yet at a deeper level, all will be fine. The expectation creates the judgment and most of them are wholly unnecessary.</p>

   <p>To help with this a practical suggestion. Every night just before you go to bed during the Christmas period write down on your phone three repeating judgments that came up about your expectations relating to Christmas. Then ask for help. From your higher self/the light/God/a religious figure/the Universe or whatever you believe in, ask for help to release all these expectations and to help you have an enjoyable stress-free Christmas. Remember this is what you really want and the expectations truly don‚Äôt matter that much.</p> 
   <p>Secondly, put your focus on high levels of self-care around Christmas. This is very difficult for beautifully giving people whose pattern becomes even more heightened with all the opportunities to give at Christmas, yet truly is in the highest good for all if understood correctly and implemented with love. True self-care is the most giving thing you can do. Make sure to do your best to exercise your body, enjoy all the delights of food and drink at Christmas whilst maintaining a healthy balance, walk out in nature if you can and most of all just take some time for yourself doing the things you love rather than constantly doing unnecessary things for others to fill the self-love hole. Self-care is essential around Christmas for you to truly take care of those you love.</p> 
   <p>Finally, you already have the best self-care practice in the world to reduce stress around Christmas. Meditation of course!! Now the temptation is to use all the time pressures of Christmas as an excuse not to do your meditation at all or to do it significantly less. Your mindset should be the exact opposite. When the pressure is higher on your time and the potential to be triggered into stress much greater, then more meditation should be at the top of your list of priorities. The benefit will be huge. It will make you much more efficient in completing your Christmas jobs (actually saving you time), help you relax into not taking everything so seriously and give you a much-needed quiet spot to spend some time alone. You deserve it.</p> 
   <p>Christmas is now going to be incredibly enjoyable and stress-free for you this year. By not taking it so seriously to the extent that you can see the perfection in the imperfection, implementing high levels of self-care, and doing more meditation than normal you have all the practical tools at your disposal to change your experience on Christmas. It will feel great. And as you feel better about Christmas, others whom you share it with will also feel much better and you will be able to nourish them with the love they truly deserve.</p> 
   <p>Happy Christmas!</p> 
   <p>With Love,</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The most important thing we should know about loneliness, is that we all feel it. Like the fight or flight response, loneliness is an emotion we carry in our biology from our evolution as a species‚Äîbecause living within a group helped ensure our survival. Loneliness is how our body tells us to pay attention to our social and emotional connections with others. And although it‚Äôs important to make sure we have an active social life, we‚Äôve also all felt lonely even when we‚Äôre surrounded by people.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In fact, we‚Äôve never lived in an era like today‚Äôs. We‚Äôre living in the most connected time ever, with a multitude of ways to connect with others, from the phone, email, websites online,  and messaging programs. But despite this, we‚Äôve never felt more alone., and . Of course, the problem is not the technology itself, as social media can actually be very helpful in finding friends, especially after a move to a new place. The issue is how we make use of these tools that we have access to now. The issue today has more to do with individualism and how we‚Äôre distancing ourselves from our communities by being glued to our shiny screens. This process has been happening since we stopped needing the support of other people to survive. We‚Äôve slowly but surely been developing a more individualistic perspective. It has its advantages, but it also takes a toll. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs a clear difference between being lonely and being alone. We all need our alone time: moments to enjoy our own company, to gather our thoughts, and rest and . But feeling lonely doesn‚Äôt feel the same as this at all. It feels like a void, like something is hurting in our chest, like something is missing. And it is. What we‚Äôre missing is a connection with other people. We all need it‚Äîmaybe some more than others, but we all do.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Loneliness can turn into a chronic condition and as a consequence, it . From aging faster to accelerating Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and cancer, loneliness weakens our immune system.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And in terms of the social side, the more we get used to feeling lonely, the more we may . We may feel defensive or judged when we do socialize, and as a response, we may isolate ourselves even more. This creates a vicious cycle that can be hard to break. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-can-we-do""><strong>What can we do?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we start to feel more lonely, we can stop and notice what‚Äôs happening. We may realize we‚Äôre isolating ourselves more, or we may notice that we‚Äôre feeling more excluded or ignored by our friends and social groups. Here‚Äôs some things we can do when we start to feel that loneliness process starting.&nbsp;</p>

How to Develop Spiritual Intimacy in a Sexual Relationship üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <div class=""wp-block-yoast-seo-table-of-contents yoast-table-of-contents""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Is sex about the physical feeling or is it more about a deep intimate love with another human being? There is no right or wrong answer. Yet for those of us on a personal growth, spiritual and/or consciousness path we feel more compelled to seek deeper levels of intimacy in our sexual relationships. And intimacy works on many levels. There is intimacy with each other‚Äôs bodies, intimacy on a mental level as we share  and intimacy on an emotional level as we share our deepest feelings. There is also spiritual intimacy. This is a rare occurrence and not an easy relationship to find and/or develop with another human being, but is something our heart can yearn for as we awaken deeper on the spiritual path.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Spiritual intimacy is intimacy on a soul level. Contrary to popular perception this is from far all love and bliss but actually tends to bring up deeper layers of pain, wounding and limitations that need to be processed. Within all this though is  and a willingness to deeply support each other through each person‚Äôs process. This type of relationship requires high levels of conscious awareness and deep levels of compassion. On the one hand, you need to be aware when you are going through a process so you don‚Äôt project onto your partner, whilst on the other hand you need to be able to hold a safe space so they can go through their own process with you radiating love by their side.</p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So how do we develop the tools to access deep spiritual intimacy in our sexual relationships?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The most important tool is meditation. Quite simply because this is the best and most flexible practice for raising your levels of awareness and allowing the light to enter more deeply into your being. Through meditation, we become more aware of all aspects of our being. And deep spiritual intimacy with another human being will start to bring to awareness shadow aspects of yourself (suppressed trauma, deep pain and self-sabotage patterns) on a much deeper level. To transform this we need the light from meditation. Through a heart-centred meditation practice that allows all aspects to be there (bodily sensations, emotions, thoughts, energetic sensations, spiritual experiences) we open ourselves more and more to the light and deeper into higher levels of awareness that are critical for successful spiritual intimacy.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Beyond meditation, there are two other key practical tools that can take spiritual intimacy to another level. These are the ability to share our shadow aspects with each other and spiritual maturity and realign how we have sex to turn it into a wonderful tool for deep spiritual transformation.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sharing shadow aspects is not easy. When we start to open up on the spiritual path we realise that we have been suppressing much trauma, deep pain, and self-sabotage which is buried very deep in the consciousness far beyond everyday normal awareness. As we awaken the light brings up these more and more. One of the best ways to process it is to share it with another human being we trust. This takes courage. There is a lot of shame and guilt associated with sharing things that aren‚Äôt aligned with the loving and light spiritual person we want to be, so we have to find someone we can trust deeply and who can understand us. This can take the form of a spiritual teacher/healer or perhaps a spiritually mature friend/family member but there is something magical about sharing it within a sexual relationship. It takes the intimacy and personal feeling to another level, which sometimes allows deeper things to be shared.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another practical technique is to transform how you use sex in a relationship. Most modern sex is done in a very unconscious manner focused on ejaculation release and a physical outlet for the stress we feel in everyday life. For deeper spiritual intimacy we need to make sex much more conscious. This can include slowing down massively to focus much more on the soul and energetic intimacy, using tantric techniques to preserve the sexual energy (i.e. no ejaculation) and creating a space where it is about sex being an expression of the deeper love you both share beyond the body. Sex can then be incredibly powerful for deeper spiritual intimacy.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As our spiritual path progresses we start to realise that the deeper intimacy we experience in a sexual relationship is really a mirror for the deeper intimacy we feel within the spiritual aspects in us. It is not about the other person it is about us. Of course, a deep sexual relationship full of love is one of the most incredible experiences we can have as a human being, but the deeper purpose is to connect us more to our own inner light and the message of our soul. Then the intimacy goes beyond human form and we sit lightly in the deep intimacy of love. This then radiates outwards not just in a sexual relationship with the person we love but in all our relationships, as we become a vessel of love in this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever noticed how, despite your dedication , your health and wellness routines tend to fall apart when you travel? If so, you‚Äôre not alone. With the best of&nbsp; intentions, we can all get caught up in the momentum of travel, thinking so much about our agendas and savoring each moment that we forget to aim for sustainability. While the temptation is to approach travel full on, it‚Äôs important to remember that staying balanced while traveling makes for the smoothest journey.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">According to the Vedic science Ayurveda, our bodies find internal harmony when all aspects of our being‚Äìphysical, mental, emotional, and spiritual‚Äì. Just like the rest of nature, our bodies are made up of the 5 elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space), which exist in different combinations called <em>doshas</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We have&nbsp; 3 Doshas:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">1. Vata (Air, Space)</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">2. Pitta (Fire, Water)</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">3. Kapha (Water, Earth)<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">They exist in different variations in each of us, creating our individual constitution . These doshas are variable, moving in and out of balance, as our environment and lifestyle choices change. Optimal health is achieved when we understand this relationship within our bodies and make lifestyle choices that support it.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

     </noscript> 
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Vata is the dosha most likely to fall out of balance when we travel. It has a quality is mobility and is associated with physiological processes such as movement, respiration, and heart rate ‚Äì also, less tangible things like thinking and emotions.&nbsp; When we‚Äôre on the move and ungrounded, it becomes dominant, causing symptoms such as brain fog, anxiety, irritability, sleeplessness, sluggish digestion and decreased immune support. This can quickly turn our travel experiences into a disaster.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In order to prevent imbalance while traveling, here are some suggestions:&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-ease-into-departure""><strong>Ease Into Departure</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the biggest mistakes is telling yourself, you‚Äôll relax<em> </em>once you arrive. This sets the stage for problems. It‚Äôs best to aim for balance before you go to keep vata dosha in check. Consider packing and making sure all travel documents are in order well in advance. Have your clothes and essentials out the night before. Stay in your routine as much as possible. Let the night before be a relaxing calm before the hustle.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-drink-water""><strong>Drink Water&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stay hydrated in the days leading up to and during travel. Your body will thank you for this. The recycled air on planes and constant air-conditioning is drying to the body and can cause dehydration. It causes dry skin, but also other Vata imbalances such as constipation, excess gas,&nbsp; poor concentration, and lethargy. Stick to water and avoid all diuretic beverages like alcohol, tea, and coffee. Cold water cools our digestive fire and can further encourage poor digestion, which is already vulnerable during travel. Therefore, warm drinks like ginger tea are preferable.<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-bring-your-own-food""><strong>Bring Your Own Food</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During travel, we often  at times when we‚Äôd otherwise not eat.&nbsp; The body doesn‚Äôt understand this timetable. This routine upset, combined with the often heavily processed foods served along the way, can cause a build up of <em>Ama</em>, or toxic residue in the body. We can honor the body best by eating a solid, grounding meal before we leave home, and packing healthy foods that we can enjoy when hunger strikes. Nutrient-rich foods like nuts and fruit (which are loaded with fiber and water), are great choices. Upon arrival, slowly slip into local cuisine, eating light and warming foods until your system acclimates to its new environment.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-reset-your-internal-clock""><strong>Reset Your Internal Clock</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Regardless of when you arrive, respect the time change. Our circadian rhythm (24-hour clock) can take time to adjust, especially when jumping time zones. At first chance, soak in some sunshine and plant your bare feet on the earth‚Ä¶dirt, grass, sand, or even asphalt. This will start to reset your internal clock. Even if you‚Äôre feeling wide awake at local bed-time, go to bed. Try to avoid sleeping-in your first morning even if you‚Äôre tempted.&nbsp; Rise at the same time you would at home.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-organize-your-space-upon-arrival""><strong>Organize Your Space Upon Arrival</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em>Vastu Shastra, </em>the Vedic science of design and sacred space (which shares the same origins as Ayurveda and Yoga), views clutter as that can upset our sense of internal balance.&nbsp; Think of it as physical ‚Äúcongestion‚Äù that can lead to unclear thinking and a hindrance to the flow of energy. Make your space your own, by unpacking your bags neatly. Clean out your carry-on bags, removing accumulated travel-day clutter and organizing receipts. Become familiar with and arrange your new space. Strip the bed and put on your own sheets (cool colors and natural fibers are best).&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-establish-a-routine""><strong>Establish a Routine</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Your first day is about re-establishing a healthy rhythm. Do your best to continue this routine as your adventure continues. As we‚Äôve established, being on the go comes with its physical challenges. Some degree of predictability can serve as an anchor.&nbsp; The more we can maintain some semblance of our tried-and-true daily rituals, the easier it will be to adapt to the changes as they arise. Maintain sleep and eating schedules <em>when possible</em>. If you have a workout regimen, keep it going. The back-pocket survival tools you utilize in daily life will serve you on the go as well.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-get-mindful""><strong>Get Mindful</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Nothing soothes excessive Vata like simple relaxation. As you know, wellness practices like yoga and meditation are the perfect tool for dealing with the stressors of change.&nbsp; They restore the baselines of homeostasis in the body and recalibrate the nervous system. In general, <em>all</em> yoga is good for grounding, though some practices are better than others.&nbsp; Fast-paced sequences can be aggravating to the system when Vata is imbalanced and we are, therefore, already prone to anxiety and mind-body fatigue. I opt for calming practices such a restorative yoga and seated meditation.</p>

The Mindful Art of Doing Nothing (While Living a Busy Life in the City) üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>How could doing nothing be a thing? And how is it possible to do nothing while living in a city and leading a busy life? After all, most cities seem to have a unique powerful force that calls for constant movement and pushes people to do more, achieve more and be more. Plus, if you do nothing in your life, how can you reach your goals, achieve your dreams, or realize projects that are important to you?<br></p>

   <p>In today‚Äôs article we‚Äôll dive into these questions, but before we do that, let‚Äôs answer an important question first: what does doing nothing imply?<br></p> 
   <p>Contrary to what many would expect, this kind of doing nothing is not about encouraging you to stay in your pajamas all day, lie in bed and refuse to participate in the world. We will approach this from a philosophy and a way of living that can allow us to be fully present with what is. It will allow us to trust the rhythm of life and how things naturally unfold.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>An ancient practice</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Although it may sound hard to believe, doing nothing is indeed a practice, and a very ancient one at that. <em>Wu wei </em>(pronounced wooh-way)<em> </em>is a Chinese word that has been translated as ‚Äúnon-doing,‚Äù ‚Äúdoing nothing,‚Äù or ‚Äúnon-resistance.‚Äù  has appeared in the <em>Tao Te Ching</em> which is said to have been written roughly 2,500 years ago, and is considered to be one of the wisest texts ever produced in human history. This universally-applicable piece of work was written by Lao Tzu and is central to the practice of Taoism.<br></p> 
   <p>In some excerpts of the <em>Tao Te Ching</em>, Tzu writes:<br><em><br></em></p> 
   <p><em>Difficult and easy complement each other.</em></p> 
   <p><em>Long and short contrast each other;</em></p> 
   <p><em>High and low rest upon each other;</em></p> 
   <p><em>Voice and sound harmonize each other;</em></p> 
   <p><em>Front and back follow one another</em><br></p> 
   <p><em>Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing</em></p> 
   <p><em>Creating, yet not possessing,</em></p> 
   <p><em>Working, yet not taking credit.</em></p> 
   <p><em>If nothing is done, then all will be well</em><br></p> 
   <p><em>Wu wei</em> does not mean to cease all action, rather, to take <em>effortless </em>and <em>strategic</em> action with a mind that is soft and alert. Strategic action requires us to act at the right time and with the right rhythm, and sometimes it requires us to do nothing at all. This delicate balance between action and inaction has also been discussed in another important text central to Vedantic thought: .<br></p> 
   <p>Doing nothing from the perspective of <em>wu wei</em> is a way of life that ensures we go with the flow and not against it. It encourages us to be at peace with whatever it is that we are or aren‚Äôt doing or whatever is happening in the moment, including the silent gaps of our lives ‚Äî those that we often try to fill in with things, relationships, experiences or entertainment.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Filling in the empty gaps</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Have you noticed that, more often than not, the moment we have some free time in our already-busy schedules, we hurry to fill it with some kind of task? This could be responding to an email, sitting in front of the TV flipping through the channels, checking our phones while we wait in line at the supermarket or while we ride public transport, hurrying to grab our mobiles when a notification comes through or spending hours navigating social media‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs as if we have declared war on free time.<br></p> 
   <p>There can be many reasons as to why we are constantly trying to fill our ‚Äúempty‚Äù time with more things, experiences and entertainment. As a society, we may have come to view doing nothing as being lazy and negative because we may not be contributing to development and economic growth as others would expect us to do.<br></p> 
   <p>On a personal level, I believe that whenever we find ourselves in a context that triggers feelings of loneliness and isolation, even if we are surrounded by people, we feel discomfort, and thus an urge to make it go away arises. This is understandable because we are mostly social creatures. In one way or another, we want to feel and stay connected to something or to others. The technological progress we have made over the years has played a big role in fulfilling this need.<br></p>

   <p>The moments when nothing ‚Äúimportant‚Äù or ‚Äúexciting‚Äù is going on in your life, how do you feel? Do you feel bored? Unproductive? Guilty for not doing anything? If so, what do you do? Do you reach for your phone and surf the internet until the feeling is gone? Do you turn on the TV and flip through the channels until you find something to distract you from your current mood? Do you go eat? Do you engage in more tasks to keep you busy even if it‚Äôs your time off? Think about how you react to the feeling for a second.<br></p> 
   <p>Have in mind that there is nothing inherently wrong in feeling how you feel and responding in a manner that seems suitable to you in that moment, whether that is spending your free time reading a good book or watching cat videos online. The key distinction here is whether you are doing it because you just want to be inspired by a good book or have a laugh while looking at incredibly adorable kittens, or because you have the urge to fill that time with something with the sole intention of making feelings of discomfort go away.</p> 
   <h2><strong>Waiting for your soul to catch up with you</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>It is said that the Nobel Prize-winning writer Andr√© Gide hired native guides when traveling through Africa in the 1920s. One morning as he was getting ready to head out and explore, his guides sat in a circle and refused to move. When Gide inquired as to why they wouldn‚Äôt move, they replied, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hurry us. We‚Äôre waiting for our souls to catch up.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p>This encapsulates the essence of doing nothing, a sacred time when we can invite our souls back into our center so that we can experience the whole of life. To do this is not to be lazy and it doesn‚Äôt require you to let go of your life as you know it, but to let go of all of that which is not essential in the moment. Although it may seem passive to many, it can actually involve intense inner work, for it is only in stillness of mind that we can reconnect with our souls and the deepest parts of our being. Doing nothing can become a wonderful opportunity to become aware of what is essential and of our soul‚Äôs journey, and to reconnect to our essence.<br></p> 
   <p>For our day to day lives, when we are always doing something and filling our time with more things to do, our thoughts lose clarity and meaning ‚Äî so pausing to enjoy a moment of non-doing promotes a positive state where we can relax and free ourselves from certain life situations that cause us stress. This is why doing nothing is actually an important component of our well-being.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Operation </strong><strong><em>wu wei</em></strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Life in the city can be fast, stressful and full of things to do, so adding more to that is truly robbing ourselves of precious time to explore the depths of our being and what it means to truly live <em>effortlessly</em>.<br></p> 
   <p>As I already mentioned, engaging in the fine art of doing nothing is not about putting your dreams behind you and quitting your life; it‚Äôs about using the empty gaps that become available to us to stop over-identifying with the past, the future, or other circumstances of our lives, all of which can keep us from the peace and presence that is always near. It‚Äôs a call to create a temporary space where we are not required to achieve anything, where we‚Äôre not being asked to be anyone ‚Äòspecial,‚Äô but to simply be. All we are required to do is to go with the flow of the moment, like someone floating down a river. What discoveries we can make during these times!<br></p> 
   <p>Have you wondered how you can practice doing nothing? It‚Äôs a rather funny and paradoxical question, isn‚Äôt it? After all, don‚Äôt we do nothing by doing nothing? One would think so‚Ä¶ but we have been technologized away from first-hand living, and we have become so reactive and accustomed to always doing something that we have disconnected from our own nature and that of going with the flow. As a result, we don‚Äôt know how to find the off button. If you have ever done yoga postures before and have struggled to stay put and mentally still in the last resting pose, then you know what I‚Äôm talking about. No wonder yogis say Savasana is the easiest pose to do, but the hardest to master.<br></p> 
   <p>Take a look at these 5 suggestions to start practicing doing nothing, even when you have a busy life. You don‚Äôt have to do them all at once. Take your time to explore them whenever it feels right for you.</p> 
   <p><br><strong>1. Beditate for a minute or two.</strong> In the book ‚Äú‚Äù, author Laurence Shorter coins the term ‚Äúbeditation.‚Äù It‚Äôs like active meditating but in bed‚Ä¶ See? <strong>Bed</strong>itation. It‚Äôs simple. When you wake up in the morning and your mind turns on like a car engine, thinking about every single thing you must do today, and oh, what a dreadful day it might turn out to be, STOP. Give yourself a few moments in bed. Keep your eyes open and become aware of your breath, and past the noise of the outer world already waking up, hear the birds chirping in harmony, identify the aromas you smell, notice the softness of your bedsheets and the comfort of your cozy home‚Ä¶ Let go of your roles, your goals, the day ahead and even your chakra cleansing routine ‚Äî you‚Äôll have time for that later ‚Äî but for now do as Shorter says and ‚Äú<em>imagine your bed is afloat on a river carrying you downstream‚Äù</em>‚Ä¶ and allow yourself to just be, to feel whatever comes up and bask in the simplicity and beauty of that moment.</p> 
   <p><strong>2. Do a technology Detox.</strong> It is such a liberating experience to get away from all technology. The beauty is that you can do this even during busy periods. The most relaxed approach is to not use any of the digital devices you own for a WHOLE weekend. You can tell who you need to tell beforehand that you are not available on weekends and that you‚Äôll catch up with everything on a <em>working</em> day.&nbsp; You can do this every weekend, and when this is not possible, you can make an effort to enjoy periods of time during the day when you don‚Äôt touch your gadgets when it‚Äôs not necessary. For instance, if you use public transportation regularly, take this wonderful time to put away your smartphone and as you would in your beditation, focus on your breath, notice the chatter around you, the sound of traffic, feel your feet deeply rooted on the ground of this incredible machine that is taking you somewhere <em>right now ‚Ä¶now</em>‚Ä¶ <em>this moment ‚Ä¶ </em>There is nothing else to think about or fill your time with, just simply feel your own presence and that of those you are sharing the ride with, and do so without any judgements and resistance to how everything is unfolding before you. You can apply the same process when you eat alone, when you‚Äôre waiting in line at the supermarket or anytime when you could choose moments of mental stillness over some kind of stimulus.</p> 
   <p><strong>3. Go bare in nature.</strong> Nature is the ultimate teacher. It is in no hurry to get things done, yet accomplishes everything in due time and form. Go learn there, without gadgets or books. You don‚Äôt have to do it every time ‚Äî after all, reading an inspiring book while being in nature can be such a refreshing experience. But what if on that one weekend nature trip, you decide to take nothing with you except the essentials to get you there and back? Find a green park in your city or better yet, find somewhere more wild, and sit by a waterfall or put a towel on the ground of a quiet forest. Breathe in the fresh air. Notice the graceful movements of the leaves rustling in the wind, hear the birds chirping, marvel at the amazing power that animates everything you see. You‚Äôll most likely get to witness the seamless balance of doing and non-resistance displayed by your natural surroundings, and the more you surround yourself with this energy, the more you‚Äôll see it permeate all areas of your life slowly but surely.</p>

   <p><strong>4. Take short silent breaks throughout the day.</strong> If you work long hours and think you can‚Äôt possibly give yourself the luxury of doing nothing, think again. You can take short breaks in between tasks at work by using the Pomodoro technique. This is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s, and it consists of several work blocks throughout the day. You set a timer for 25 minutes and dedicate all your attention to the task at hand without distractions, then after 25 minutes, you set the timer for a 5-minute pause. Do 3 more 25-minute blocks with 5-minute breaks in between; after your fourth block take a 15-minute break before beginning another similar work block. Not only will this allow you to be very productive and focused, but it will also give you some time off even when working. When you take these 5 and 15-minute breaks, take your body and mind off the task at hand and do nothing! Maybe stand by a window and look at the trees, observe people walking by or sit still and take a few conscious breaths. Do a quick mental body scan and notice how you feel in your body, mind and spirit. Don‚Äôt let your mind wander off into the next task, and just be present and at peace with yourself.</p> 
   <p><strong>5. Sign up for a Vipassana retreat.</strong> The most popular form of Vipassana is the one taught by S.N. Goenka. It consists of going to a secluded center where you surrender all but your most essential objects (and by essential I mean your toiletry bag, not your phone). For 10 days, from morning to dawn, you will learn techniques to sit quietly with yourself and explore the depths of your being. Reading, writing, listening to music, exercising and of course talking are off limits. All your basic needs such as water, food and shelter will be taken care of by kind volunteers so you can focus on yourself and your quiet time. Vipassana, which means to ‚Äúsee things as they really are‚Äù is an intense but rewarding practice for those in search of peace and stillness. This is the ultimate practice of non-doing and non-resistance ‚Äî <em>wu wei</em> at its best. There are Vipassana centers all over the world so you may not have to travel far to find one; explore all of Dhamma‚Äôs centers . The next big decision on your part will be to find the time and willingness to take 10 days off, plus the time you‚Äôll need to get there.</p> 
   <p>No matter where we are or how busy we are, we can always come back to our center when we allow these silent and empty gaps to open up in our lives instead of resisting and fighting them. Try doing nothing and give your soul a chance to catch up with you.</p> 
   <p>Be well,</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever been frustrated by the behaviour of others?

All can be .</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Compassion has three key aspects to it: trust, acceptance, and non-judgment. It is the ability to tap into the awakened self which realises everything at a deeper level is completely fine, yet also feel a deep heart-felt love for others who are too stuck in their own suffering to see this radiant truth. From this space, trust, acceptance and non-judgment flow without effort.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Who could not trust if they truly realised everything at a deeper level was fine and love never left? Who could not accept if they realised they had no idea about what was truly in a person‚Äôs best interests? And who could judge if they truly realised the limitations of their own conditioned beliefs?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-awakened-self-is-in-all-of-us""><strong>The awakened self is in all of us.</strong>&nbsp;</h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We each have a personality self (body, emotions, mental), an observer self (which can observe the personality) and an awakened self (which allows the light from the heart to flow into the personality and for us to reach our highest potential). The awakened self is already fully compassionate. It uses the personality as a vessel for compassion to be brought into the world, rather than just using the personality in isolation which results in behaviour, not in alignment with true compassion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Where many meditation students and those interested in spirituality get stuck is they then get level confusion and start to apply the insights of the awakened self (which they generally only ) on a worldly level, without realising of universal wisdom in the awakened self.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-universal-wisdom-guides-you-on-how-to-behave-in-the-world""><strong>Universal wisdom guides you on how to behave in the world.</strong>&nbsp;</h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We each have a different personality self and so many different contexts we face in our life, so to align compassion with exact behaviour or actions would be ridiculous.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Instead, we must be quieter and listen to the universal wisdom in our hearts. This becomes a lot easier as we quieten through meditation and other spiritual practices, allowing us to tap into and understand what universal wisdom truly is. Rather than make the decisions from our own conditioning (which is so limited when you truly see it), we start to make decisions from  that truly knows what is in the best interest of all. This results in us flowing with compassion naturally and from there behaviours aligned with trust, acceptance, and non-judgment naturally arise.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-so-what-can-you-do-to-cultivate-compassion""><strong>So what can you do to cultivate compassion?</strong>&nbsp;</h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">More accurately, what can you do to align more with the awakened self from which compassion flows?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The key practice is meditation. This helps our levels of awareness rise exponentially and is the most prominent practice for aligning with the awakened self. All other spiritual practices are really just preparation for this. To commit to a dailyis truly the most productive thing you can do to cultivate more compassion in your life for others, as well as get all the other amazing benefits of it.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The second key technique is to reverse-engineer certain behaviours that flow from compassion. This is not the most direct way but is helpful on the path. By starting to behave from a place of acceptance, non-judgment, and trust we can plug ourselves more closely into the vibration of compassion and the awakened self. As we implement these behaviours it is vital to be practical and wise. We need to have firm boundaries that work in the real world but come internally from a place of trust, non-judgment, and acceptance. Often these things can result in strong behaviour. There is no need to please anybody or live up to certain ideals, with true compassion also encompassing things that can upset others as it hits their ego. Our hearts still bleed for their suffering though and from their awakened self.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As compassion gets cultivated more and more we come to a place of total acceptance of where others are at. We can be present to their ignorance, their suffering and their lack of awareness without feeling the  or make them live up to our own ideals. Compassion doesn‚Äôt judge. Although we are more aware of others‚Äô limitations, behind this veil all we see is the love that underpins everything and that everything is truly made of. Compassion is an aspect of true love for life.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So the next time you feel like judging someone from a place of nonacceptance and lack of trust, breath and re-consider your decision. What do the light and universal wisdom of your awakened self want you to do? Through meditation and reverse-engineering behaviours of trust, acceptance, and non-judgment this answer will become more and more obvious as you become aligned with your awakened self. Then compassion flows, without effort and with infinite love.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The human body is&nbsp;a miraculous machine, engineered with awesome and finely-tuned systems that support us in. Each of us is carried silently by these innate, guiding forces that help us navigate our individual experiences. One of the most basic, yet fascinating, systems&nbsp; is something known as our biological clock. We can think of this clock as an intrinsic timing device‚Äì fundamental to the functioning , organization, and coordination of our everyday behavior. Essentially, it regulates our body‚Äôs processes, keeping everything running on a consistent schedule.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-our-biological-clock""><strong>Our Biological Clock</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our biological clocks drive one of of ‚Äî a sleep-wake cycle called our Circadian Rhythm that produces physical, mental, and behavioral changes in response to the sun. It‚Äôs designed to keep us tethered to it‚Äôs rising and setting, awake and alert by day and tired as we move toward the evening hours. As the light fades, day turning to night, our brains release a hormone called melatonin that signal it to begin to power down and prepare for sleep. As the light returns, after a period of rest, we wake to greet the day with a sense of renewal.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When our bodies are exposed to artificial light in the evening, it can be confusing to the and interfere with this system. Blue light, in particular‚Äìthe type of light emitted from smartphones, tablets, and LED screens‚Äìcan be a major disruptor in this natural sleep-wake cycle because it cues the body to react as it would to the rising sun. The light the eyes receive, from these devices, signals the pineal gland in the brain to suppress the production of melatonin, which typically makes us feel sleepy.&nbsp; Instead, at a time when nature intends relaxation and recovery, we feel stimulated and restless.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-does-blue-light-affect-sleep""><strong>How Does Blue Light Affect Sleep?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Blue light not only delays the moment of falling asleep, to varying degrees, but it also reduces REM and shifts the circadian clock so that people wake up later.&nbsp; Overtime, this change in our regular rhythm, which governs the healthy release of hormones, eating habits, digestion, body temperature, and other important bodily functions, can cause even more complex health issues. According to ,&nbsp; irregular circadian rhythms have been linked to, not only sleep disorders, but other&nbsp; various chronic health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, depression, bipolar disorder, and seasonal affective disorder.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By eliminating our exposure to blue light in the evening hours, we take conscious action to regulate this important bodily system‚Äìand, in doing so, take more responsibility in maintaining our health. The most effective way to do so is by&nbsp; imposing a ‚Äúdigital curfew‚Äù in your home. By avoiding any exposure an hour or two before bedtime, you allow the body to internally prepare, by producing melatonin and avoiding stimulation, .&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-limit-your-smartphone-usage""><strong>Limit Your Smartphone Usage</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This can be a hard habit to break, especially for those of us accustomed to being constantly&nbsp; plugged in and turned on. Most of us can relate to having our smartphones within arms reach, as we settle into our beds, especially if you use it as an alarm clock. One simple alert of a new email, text, or , and, the next thing you&nbsp; know, you‚Äôre mindlessly scrolling. Each of these prompts releases dopamine, a ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù chemical messenger in the brain. It‚Äôs acts very similar to any other addiction, so it can be nearly impossible to resist the urge to pick up our devices. Therefore, a great place to start is by removing smart phones and all other devices from the bedroom.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôre not ready to give up your devices at bedtime, just yet‚Äì or if work on the computer in the evening hours‚Äì there are several other alternatives to decrease your blue light exposure in the evening. The first is to simply dim the screen or use a screen filter that can be attached to your device, to limit both blue and UV light. These are the easiest, yet least effective, of your options.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-blue-light-filter""><strong>Blue Light Filter</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Alternatively, there are new apps available that automatically change the color tones on your screen from blue to warmer ones like yellow, orange, and red. These tones, similar to a sunset, cue the body for rest. Many devices have a built in function that allows you to automatically alter the colors of the screen to the warmer end of the color spectrum at. If you go to Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness you can often change it yourself. While these apps and features are not capable of removing <em>all</em> blue light emitted from our devices, and can cause increased eye strain from the lack of contrast and image distortion, they do offer a partial solution.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another option, which can be used alone or along with other light-filtering solutions, are blue light glasses. Just like the apps and screen filters, these glasses are also designed to adjust our exposure to harmful wavelengths emitted from smartphones, tablets, and computers. They‚Äôre believed to be a comprehensive solution that prevents excessive eye strain, as well as sleep-related problems. They come in many styles and various sizes, for all ages.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôve been experiencing any sleep disturbance, and are like many others who are staring at screens more than ever, give some consideration to these blue light reducers. You might find that&nbsp; one or more of these ‚Äúsmall fixes‚Äù offer huge rewards. There is no denying that we live in a world where Instagram rabbit-holes, Netflix binges, and long hours behind a computer are a real, not-so-unusual, thing.&nbsp; Awareness is the key to offering ourselves support for an easier ride.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. Have you ever considered your blue light exposure? Have you ever tried one of these filters? If so, did you notice any difference in your sleep patterns or ?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

   <p>Are you someone who loves waking early or do you like to sleep in? This seemingly unimportant question is actually fundamental. Whether we are a morning person or a night owl changes the way we relate to our daily activities and to our sleep. Let‚Äôs discover together what a chronotype is, how you can determine what your chronotype is and how to adjust your daily schedule to better enjoy your days and finally sleep like a baby!<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-is-a-chronotype""><strong>What is a chronotype?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Simply put, your chronotype is what describes your ability to be active and productive either in the morning, afternoon or in the evening. It‚Äôs your biological characteristic that makes you say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a morning person‚Äù if this is the case for you.&nbsp; Of course, this is not the only information that our chronotype contains. It tells us about , about your appetite at different times throughout the day, about your ideal time to work to have a maximum amount of concentration, and much more. It is, in some way, your internal personal clock.</p> 
   <p>Our chronotype is not only determined by our biological make-up. It is also influenced by genetic, psychological, and environmental factors. That does mean that our lifestyle impacts our chronotype, although it does stay pretty stable throughout our lives. Of course, it can evolve in time: A lot of people have a tendency to wake up earlier as they get older. However, this evolution is very gradual, we don‚Äôt radically change chronotype.&nbsp; It goes without saying that it‚Äôs better to try and organize our lives around it to better enjoy our days rather than to suffer through them! If you have trouble sleeping, I would advise you to do your research: This might just be the tool you need to adjust your daily routine and enjoy better sleep.</p> 
   <p>, American clinical psychologist known in the United States as the ‚Äúsleep doctor‚Äù, specializes in chronobiology, which is the studies of organisms biological rhythms. After doing advanced research he has come up with a questionnaire that allows everyone to determine their own chronotype.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-to-be-a-morning-person-or-a-night-owl-learning-about-ourselves""><strong>To be a morning person or a night owl | Learning about ourselves</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>It turns out it‚Äôs not a legend: Some of us are morning people, some of us are night owls. Some of us are more adaptable and our chronotype is not as black and white but we still have some characteristics that determine what is better for us to feel good throughout the day. In any case, knowing your chronotype allows you to know yourself better, but also to break down the myth that ‚ÄúThe early morning has gold in its mouth.‚Äù I have to admit that this sentence is frustrating to people who, like me, don‚Äôt enjoy waking up at the crack of dawn. To be totally honest, when I open my eyes in the early morning, my first thoughts are that there is not enough gold in the world to make me want to get up! All joking apart, knowing your biological rhythm gives us the power to be efficient exactly at the time when it‚Äôs easiest for us. This helps us understand that productivity is not only a question of willpower or motivation, but it also depends on our internal clock, which is totally different from one person to the next.<br></p> 
   <p>Our chronotype confirms once more that we are all different. Even if there are broad categories of chronotypes, ‚Äì Dr. Breus categorizes all 4 chronotypes under animal names, to help us better figure out what mammal we might relate with the most ‚Äì people with the same chronotype are clearly not exactly the same. If, after taking the test you find out that you are a morning person (or a lion, according to Dr. Breus) it‚Äôs totally possible that you are used to getting up later than the psychologist suggests, but that you can relate with the description of the lion. These categories are only there to help us understand ourselves better and to try and adjust our daily schedule to match our internal clock.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-respect-your-own-biological-rhythm""><strong>Respect your own biological rhythm</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Our daily obligations force us to often act in the opposite way that our biological nature would require. If a part of the population (about 15 to 20%) are naturally early risers, the others struggle to face head-on what is expected of them during the first hours of the day. Luckily, there are ways to compensate for that gap between what our bodies need and what our daily life requires. Here are some of the reasons why it‚Äôs so important to respect your own biological rhythm:<br></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li><strong>For better sleep!</strong> Indeed, by being aware of your chronotype, you can act in a way that allows you to promote your sleep. If you are one of those people who have trouble sleeping, you will find some helpful advice depending on your chronotype when taking the test at the end of this article.</li> 
    <li><strong>For more efficient work. </strong>It‚Äôs obvious that when we know whether we are early risers or night owls it‚Äôs easier to decide which hours during the day our brain can be more productive. For people who are unable to change their work hours, it might be a possibility to adjust the time at which certain tasks can be achieved. For those who don‚Äôt feel really productive until 3 or 4pm (because, yes, there is a category for us, too!) it might be beneficial to work on easier tasks in the morning and take on tasks that require more concentration in the afternoon, for example.</li> 
    <li><strong>For healthier eating.</strong> Here again, we do not have the same rhythm. Some people are not hungry as soon as they wake up, and there is nothing wrong with that! We need to learn to listen to our body‚Äôs needs at different times throughout the day.&nbsp;</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>You understand now that knowing your chronotype is learning to find a balance by listening to our own internal clock. It‚Äôs now time for you to discover your chronotype by taking Dr. Breus‚Äô test.  and come back to let us know what you found out: So? What mammal are you?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs 5:30am and I‚Äôve awoken in my favorite way‚Äìjust several minutes before my alarm, so the first sound I hear is the movement of my breath.&nbsp; In this moment, even in my early-morning haze, I know I have choices. I can reach for my phone and start scrolling, I can make a mental check-list of today‚Äôs to-do list and hit the ground running, or I can slowly rise, make my bed, and head directly to my  cushion.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Today, I choose the cushion. To meet myself before I greet the world.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I head to my cushion because I know that life is a series of choices. The decisions we make create the stage for each individual day and, ultimately, become the story of our lives.&nbsp; It‚Äôs easy to forget that each moment holds immense power to shape our experiences and that they are linked through time, like pearls on a string. The more intentionally we place each pearl, the more beautiful our necklace becomes. In this analogy, I find my strength to act with intention and to see the opportunity that lives, in even the smallest things, to create the life I desire.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When I choose meditation to begin my day, I‚Äôm carefully stringing my next pearl. I‚Äôm consciously creating space for something I value, knowing it carries a potential that enables me to relate to my world feeling calm, grounded, and aligned. It‚Äôs a way of re-committing to my best self, every day, and prioritizing this higher perspective for my well-being. It‚Äôs my inner proclamation that, while I trust in life‚Äôs fluidity and chance unfolding, I will journey with a strong mental reference point to navigate my path.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Establishing a healthy morning routine is something many of us desire. Though, oftentimes, when incorporating something new into our routines, there‚Äôs a tendency to return to the familiar ways that most feel comfortable. What I‚Äôve learned is that <em>knowing</em> what is best for us is rarely enough to propel most people into action. Our habits are deeply embedded and shifting them requires a significant amount of deliberate intention, discipline, and patience. Here are some tips, to serve as an anchor while exploring a morning meditation practice:</p>

   <h2 id=""h-1-get-clear-on-why-a-new-meditation-routine-is-important-to-you""><em>1. Get clear on Why a New Meditation Routine is Important to You</em></h2> 
   <p>The ultimate push to starting any new routine is understanding exactly <em>why </em>it‚Äôs so important to you in the first place. The clearer you can become on its value, the likelier you are to show up relentlessly while you restructure your life. Meditation has been scientifically proven to reduce stress, control anxiety, promote emotional health, enhance self-awareness, improve memory, regulate sleep, manage pain, encourage a peaceful state of mind, and more. Getting very specific on your personal desire will be your fuel.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>For example, I am committing to my practice because:&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>‚ÄúI want to be more patient and present for my children.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúMy anxiety is affecting my relationships.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúThis is a dream opportunity, and I need as much focus as possible.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúI desire healthier options to manage my chronic pain.‚Äù</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-visualize-a-new-morning-routine""><em>2. Visualize a New Morning Routine&nbsp;</em></h2> 
   <p>Getting clear on your new routine will prime you for success. There‚Äôs already a system in place that wants to perpetuate itself.&nbsp; As Aristotle once said, ‚ÄúWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.‚Äù Make space for what you want to create.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>First, write down, step-by-step, what your typical morning looks like. Then write down what you would <em>like</em> it to look like. My suggestion is small, incremental changes rather than shaking your morning foundation to the core on day one. Habits are formed, maintained, and changed in a ‚Äúhabit loop‚Äù:&nbsp; cue ‚Üí behavior ‚Üí reward. According to Charles Duhigg in his book, The Power of Habit, the key to successfully changing our behavior is to keep the <em>cue</em> and <em>reward </em>the same. For instance, maybe your morning, in its most simplistic version, looks like this:<br></p> 
   <p>-Phone alarm sounds (cue)&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>-Check Facebook, Instagram, and email messages (behavior)</p> 
   <p>-Shower (reward)</p> 
   <p>-Caffeine/breakfast (reward)&nbsp;</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-at-first-keep-it-simple-change-only-the-behavior"">At first, keep it simple. Change only the behavior:</h3> 
   <p>-Alarm Clock (cue)</p> 
   <p>-Meditation for 10 minutes (behavior)</p> 
   <p>-Shower (reward)</p> 
   <p>-Caffeine/breakfast (reward)</p> 
   <p>-Now, check media&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Spend about 30 days recreating this habit before adding anything new. Over time, you may want to explore more habit change, such as going to bed earlier as meditation time increases.&nbsp; This model will work just as well.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-create-a-designated-meditation-space"">3. <em>Create a Designated Meditation Space&nbsp;</em></h2> 
   <p>Create a space that will invite you in. While having a designated room for meditation isn‚Äôt a possibility for many people,&nbsp; most of us have the space to create a special indoor or outdoor nook where we can get still and reflect, to refocus our inner life. When we  erecting an external sanctuary for deep connection, it serves as a reminder, every time we see it, of our highest intentions‚Äìa prompt to pause, within the action of our lives, to self-nourish.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>When considering your sacred space, reflect back upon your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for committing to your practice. My two greatest intentions for my morning meditation, for instance, are fostering a connection with nature and my family. Therefore, my space has a small altar with plants I nurture, as well as stones, shells, and driftwood I‚Äôve collected on my wanderings. I have several photos of my son and family, and a beautiful organic, natural-fiber meditation cushion where I can settle in and feel completely aligned. Let your space, simple or elaborate, become a reliable home and an expression of <em>you.</em></p>

   <p>One of my favorite yoga teachers, Jillian Pransky, says, ‚ÄúA Little + Often = A LOT‚Äù. While she was referring to yoga, regularity and consistency are the bedrock of <em>any</em> wellness practice. The important thing is to show up and reorient yourself with this practice every day.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Many people love the idea of meditation but realize when they get to the actual meditation <em>practice, </em>that they don‚Äôt like it all. This is completely normal. It‚Äôs easy for our racing thoughts to go unnoticed while we go about our busy lives.&nbsp; This may be the first time, you‚Äôre taking notice of what lies beneath the surface and it can be extremely uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúThis is boring.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúWho‚Äôs got time for this?‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúWhat was I thinking?‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúThere is so much else I should be doing.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm SO not good at this!‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúHow long have I been here?‚Äù</p> 
   <p>‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm doing. Time for breakfast.‚Äù</p> 
   <p>These thoughts WILL arise‚Ä¶and, remember, they are precisely why you are here.</p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>To notice the antics of the thinking mind (and, yes, be shocked at how it never stops)</li> 
    <li> to change our relationship with these thoughts for some mental spaciousness and calm.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>Stay seated and start where you are. Begin with 5-10 minutes your first week, and then increase your sit-time as feels appropriate. Simply, get comfortable, close your eyes, and breathe naturally. As thoughts arise, breathe them away on the exhale.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>In time, as it has for so many of us, this may become your favorite time of the day, something you run towards rather than away from. Best of luck on your meditation journey.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I can‚Äôt meditate.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs not for me.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs not working.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I don‚Äôt have time for it.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I just can‚Äôt seem to focus.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Do any of these sound familiar?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These days,  and its benefits are becoming more prominent in the Western world thanks to all the scientific research on how meditation benefits the brain. Many of  have come to similar conclusions: meditation changes the brain in areas associated with memory, focus, and learning. It has also been known to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and helps us to regulate our emotions, especially the ‚Äúnegative‚Äù ones, thus giving us a chance to choose how we respond to them and become less affected by them. All of these effects lead to improved states of well-being.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Despite hearing about the benefits of meditation over and over, many still shy away from the practice for various reasons. I personally know many friends who recount being physically and emotionally tired of living their lives. They describe feeling like they‚Äôre on a roller coaster: one day they‚Äôre reaching for the sky, and the next one they‚Äôre plummeting down fast. Finding peace is a struggle, but when I suggest meditation, one of the typical responses mentioned at the beginning comes up.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a frequent and long-time meditator I know first-hand that trying to establish a consistent meditation practice is not a walk in the park. We all face many different obstacles along the way that can thwart our efforts or derail us from even starting. If you are new to the practice or if you‚Äôre considering giving meditation a try, watch out for the following 5 common obstacles.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-1-finding-time""><strong>1. Finding time</strong><br></h2> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p><em>‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt have time to meditate for an hour every day, you should meditate for two.‚Äù</em> <br></p><cite><em>‚Äì Zen proverb.</em></cite> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">While meditating for two hours may not be realistic for you, 10 minutes might be‚Ä¶<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Telling yourself you don‚Äôt have time to meditate is one of the most clever justifications the mind uses to stop you from even starting. The fact of the matter is that many of us lead busy lives in this world, especially if we live in a city, have jobs and a family. We all probably have bills to pay, work to do, school meetings to attend, grocery shopping to do, dishes to clean, and families to take care of.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the midst of a rather hectic schedule, it may seem that using our downtime to meditate is irresponsible and unrealistic, or at least that‚Äôs what our minds tell us. Nevertheless, 10 minutes of silence can give us space to recharge our battery, rest our emotions and minds,&nbsp; and stop the drone of our worries, doubts, fears, the daily meaningless mental chatter, and even the voice of others. 10 minutes to enjoy the quiet calm of silence is not being irresponsible, and our lives will certainly not fall apart as a result.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you feel that you can‚Äôt find 10 minutes for yourself, then <em>create</em> them. You know your own patterns and so you can create this break where it occurs naturally in your life. If you‚Äôre a morning person, you could wake up a little earlier than usual and choose a cozy corner of your room or take a seat in bed and set a 10-minute alarm. If you are not a morning person, you can take the silent time at your office during your lunch break or in the evening when you get home. If you have a family to take care of, you may take the time when your kids are off to school in the morning, or you may even encourage your whole family to meditate with you! If you feel you‚Äôre extremely busy then you may have to change certain habits to make space for your 10 minutes of meditation, such as foregoing the evening news or a TV show you‚Äôre used to watching.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The bottom line is: pick a regular time every day, preferably at the same place for the same amount of time, and commit to silently sitting still or practicing with the aid of a meditation app. At this stage, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you were not able to focus on anything and your mind ran loose in circles instead. At first, the most important step is to create the time and turn it into a habit. With time, the rest will follow suit.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-2-thinking-it-s-a-waste-of-time""><strong>2. Thinking it‚Äôs a waste of time</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another trick your mind might play is convincing you that you‚Äôre wasting your time. While it may be true that you have a lot of things to do, it is equally true that taking time to clear your mind is not a waste of time. In fact, it is quite effective in improving your memory, as well as your problem-solving and planning skills.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What some consider to be a waste of time while meditating is actually an inability to stay put for even 10 minutes. This is by far one of the most difficult parts when you get into meditation ‚Äî it happens to all of us, and not just at the beginning. I‚Äôve had countless meditation sessions where I sat down to ‚Äúmeditate.‚Äù 20 minutes would pass and all would do was entertain my monkey mind: ‚ÄúYou need to do this, you haven‚Äôt done that, what will I eat for lunch? God, I haven‚Äôt paid the electricity bill, when will this meditation session be over?‚Äù This is all normal, especially if you are not used to being in silence.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the beginning, your internal dialogue may become even more turbulent, and this is where many people give up and say that they are wasting their time with meditation. If you‚Äôre at this stage, don‚Äôt give up now: this is just resistance from the mind, like a child making a fuss over something they don‚Äôt want to do. The mind wants to run away from quiet time because after all, talking and thinking endlessly is the mind‚Äôs domain and what it does best. As you stay with the experience of meditating, your internal dialogue will begin to subside and eventually the inner stillness will become profound, and not just for your seated meditation, but for everything that you do in life. The best approach here is to be patient and kind with yourself, persevere no matter what and start small. Five or 10 minutes of uninterrupted mental peace will prove more beneficial than fighting your way through 20 minutes of ‚Äútrying‚Äù to meditate.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Just like you wouldn‚Äôt go to the gym and start doing intense workouts without warming up first, as a new meditator, you may not want to start meditating for an hour straight only to convince yourself that meditation doesn‚Äôt work for you or that you‚Äôre just wasting your time and have better things to do! 5-10 minutes can be your warm-up, and eventually, when feel the need, you can increase your meditation time. Start small, going step by step, and take the process from there.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And remember: making time for yourself to look within and give the nervous mind a break is not a waste of your precious time. It‚Äôs a service for yourself, for your mental health, for your soul and even the well-being of those around you.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-3-not-knowing-where-to-start""><strong>3. Not knowing where to start‚Ä¶</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Fair enough.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With so many meditation techniques available, it can be confusing to know how to start meditating. After all, we can meditate cross-legged, lying down, walking and even while doing the dishes! You may have to try out different techniques to find out which ones suit your needs best according to the context. You may also find that different forms of meditation will speak to you at different stages of your life.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Although I am not the biggest fan of technology, I must admit that it has made meditation more accessible to almost everyone, in every corner of the globe. Whereas in the past, meditation seekers had to travel far and wide to learn to clear their minds, now we have the convenience of doing so anywhere and anytime with the help of our gadgets.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you have a smartphone and an internet connection you can download meditation apps that will teach you techniques that many of our most cherished ancient traditions have tried to teach us. If you need guidance for your meditation practice, I highly recommend that you check out Meditopia. They have an incredible array of guided meditation series and music, organized in a way that beginners and more experienced meditators alike can easily follow.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-4-shunning-the-practice-due-to-popular-or-religious-beliefs""><strong>4. Shunning the practice due to popular or religious beliefs</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Many people surprisingly shy away from meditation because it has been boxed into the ‚Äúnew age‚Äù category. Others are afraid that it will come up against their religious beliefs.&nbsp; The practice of meditation is neither new nor is it a religion.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First, meditation has been around for a long time and has been discussed in many of the most ancient spiritual texts known to humankind such as <em>The Vedas</em>, which dates back as far as 1500 BCE. And secondly, meditation will not interfere with any of your religious beliefs and practices because it is not a practice of calling on to God or any deity, but a time we dedicate to <em>our mind</em>, to train it to be still, objective and peaceful. If anything, meditation will make your connection to whatever it is that you believe in stronger; it will make you feel more peaceful, more compassionate and more loving towards all that lives, which in essence is the core message of all religious traditions around the world.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-5-believing-that-it-is-an-instant-magic-pill""><strong>5. Believing that it is an instant magic pill</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It is important to understand that meditation is not a magic pill that will take you to a miraculous place where all of your problems and tribulations will be forgotten or solved overnight. After you‚Äôre done with your meditation practice, you still have to get up and navigate the world, you still have to deal with your ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù boss or colleagues, you still have to go to work, pay your bills, do the dishes and engage in every aspect of your personal, professional and social life.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So meditation will not make your responsibilities go away, rather it will help you go about them with more care, attentiveness, and reverence. Your moody boss is no longer an annoying person but a human being like yourself who is simply having a bad day or difficult problems in his or her life; doing the dishes is no longer that compulsory activity that no one wants to do after eating but instead becomes an opportunity to be in the moment and enjoy your own presence; the work you may dislike is no longer a total unbearable torture but a temporary source of money that allows you to have a roof over your head and food on your table. No, meditation is not a magical pill, but it does allow us to see and experience the magic of life through the good and the rough times.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If we want to lead happy and peaceful lives we must put in the necessary work to allow that to happen ‚Äî and meditation is a great tool to help us do precisely that.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you remember only one thing out of all we have discussed here, let it be the idea to be patient, compassionate, consistent and above all, to start now! As Rabindranath Tagore said, ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt cross the sea merely by staring at the water.‚Äù So go on and embark upon the greatest journey of your life, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to people who have a little more experience, join a meditation group or try a meditation app such as Meditopia.<br></p>

My Life Has Been Turned Upside Down | How Do I Handle It? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Sometimes life can often look and feel like a roller coaster ride. When our life has been turned upside down, for whatever reason, we might feel confused and lost. In today‚Äôs article, we will look at the most appropriate attitude to carry during periods of chaos and, also, how to develop our ability to face change throughout our life. What steps can we take when we are faced with big changes? How do we adapt to new situations without unnecessary suffering?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>My life has been turned upside down‚Ä¶ | Acceptance</p> 
   <p>When you are confronted with a big change in your life, no matter the nature of the change, it can be very difficult to accept. Your reference points are turned upside down, your habits swept away, and you can sometimes experience a feeling of despair. Whether you took the initiative to make this change or if it was something that was forced upon you, it can be challenging to feel at peace again. The very first thing to do, when your life is turned upside down, is to look at the facts:&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>You might be experiencing something big and brand new in your life. Even though this might seem obvious, it‚Äôs important to recognize. It is often difficult to realize the importance of what we are enduring because we are swept in the whirlwind that this change is bringing into our lives.</p> 
   <p>If you are reading this while going through a major life change, take a moment (ideally in a quiet place where you can have some privacy) to say to yourself,&nbsp; ‚ÄúMy life has been turned upside down. I feel‚Ä¶‚Äù . Complete this sentence with the first word that comes from the deepest part of your heart. Don‚Äôt be afraid of the strong emotions that might arise. Laugh, cry, yell, smile‚Ä¶let yourself experience these feelings fully. It‚Äôs only when you are completely mindful about your emotions and you can move towards a renewed sense of balance. Accepting that you are going through a process and period of internal chaos will help you to feel at peace.</p> 
   <p>Social pressure, the impressions of others, the need to appear strong‚Ä¶all of these things can make you quick to say you‚Äôre ok and have a good grasp on the situation, even if you feel lost. I would like to remind you: it‚Äôs ok not to feel strong, to feel totally lost, or shaken up. It‚Äôs not a bad thing and is actually, most often, quite healthy to know and recognize these strong emotions.<br>We are human. We all experience these emotions without exception. And you know what? Expressing your feelings is also beneficial for others, because you invite them to do the same. Be open to feeling your emotions fully and this way you will be able to go through the storm. If you allow these emotions to move through you, they will continue to flow, leaving you stronger and more in tune with yourself.</p>

   <h2>Facing change</h2> 
   <p>Once you make peace with your feelings and accept that you feel out of balance because of a new reality, you can face the challenge of change. The question is, how will you face this change?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Visualizations are exercises that can help those who are going through a difficult situation. They are tools that help us imagine ourselves as if we had already weathered the storm.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>To do this, you can take a pencil and a piece of paper and write what you imagine what resolution will look like. For example, ‚ÄúOnce I‚Äôll feel at peace with this change, I‚Äôll be, I‚Äôll do‚Ä¶‚Äù . By considering that you will one day be at peace with what is changing, you can effectively encourage yourself through the process.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>It‚Äôs also important to focus on the fact that any change is an opportunity for growth. It‚Äôs obvious that some changes are harder to accept than others, especially when they are sudden and not fully understood. However, in each case, a reliable truth remains: the end of one thing is the beginning of another. In this way, it will get easier to see the possibility of something positive occurring with any event.</p>

   <h2>How to adapt to change?&nbsp;</h2> 
   <p>As Buddhists say, one of the greatest causes of suffering is our reluctance towards accepting change. By nature, life is ever evolving, and impermanence is probably the most accurate way to describe it. As you probably know very well, life is simply a succession of moments that feel balanced and out of balance at times. If we don‚Äôt learn to live with this reality, we can create much of our own suffering. It can become easy to feel unsettled in our day-to-day and to have a very hard time finding stability when life balances back out.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Thankfully, you have this ability to adapt to change. A perfect metaphor of adaptation to change is the image of reeds. Reeds have the unique ability to bend under the strongest winds without ever breaking. They are solid, yet very flexible, which is precisely what gives them their strength. You have a similar flexibility to survive the constant, and sometimes dramatic, changes that can arise throughout your life.</p> 
   <p>One of the most efficient ways of learning to adapt to change is, of course, practicing meditation. It reveals the vastness of your strength, showing how to unravel yourself from the limiting thoughts that tell you that you weren‚Äôt capable of survival in various situations. Meditating does not tell you not to react to what is happening.

Quit Smoking with the Help of Meditation üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>According to the World Health Organization, more than 1.1 billion people smoke worldwide, making smoking the world‚Äôs leading preventable cause of death. Unfortunately, knowing all of the statistics don‚Äôt make much of a difference when it comes to the will of a smoker wanting to quit. That‚Äôs not because smokers are weak, but because in addition to the powerful physical addiction to nicotine, smoking is also an emotional addiction. Smoking becomes like a companion for every occasion, a comforting friend we can lean on at any given time.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-why-do-we-smoke""><strong>Why do we smoke?&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>If you‚Äôre a smoker like me, chances are you started very early in life and that your environment and friends influenced you to try that first one. It took me a while to admit it, because as is the case for most people, facing our own weaknesses isn‚Äôt easy. Yet that‚Äôs nothing to blame yourself for; we‚Äôre not perfect and our past has already come and gone, so the only thing we can do is focus on the now.</p> 
   <p>Regardless of the reason you started smoking, you‚Äôve probably continued because of the way it makes you feel: smoking can ‚Äúcure‚Äù or substitute almost anything. It can be a reward when we get what we want, it can be a consolation prize when we don‚Äôt, it can fill a void we feel, from the most trivial situations, like waiting for the bus to come, to more existential states like depression or anxiety. And that‚Äôs the reason why it‚Äôs so difficult to stop: we know it‚Äôs not good for us, but it just feels so good.</p> 
   <p>I mean if it felt bad it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue to stop, am I right?</p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p> the standard behavioral approach to quit smoking doesn‚Äôt work so well because it only takes away the symptoms without treating the causes. </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-is-it-so-difficult-to-quit-smoking""><strong>Why is it so difficult to quit smoking?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Although having a strong desire to quit smoking is crucial, it‚Äôs not nearly enough to be able to actually do it. We have to analyze this from two points of view: the psychological and physical dependence. From the scientific point of view: smoking, like any other drug, releases dopamine, which makes it pleasurable to use,‚Äù explains Dr. Neil Benowitz, a nicotine researcher at the University of California, San Francisco. ‚ÄúAnd when you stop smoking, you have a deficiency of dopamine release, which causes a state of dysphoria: you feel anxious or depressed‚Äù. Additionally, Dr. Benowitz noted that nicotine can be just as addictive as heroin.</p> 
   <p>On the other hand, there‚Äôs also the emotional dependence. When we try to quit we‚Äôre faced with symptoms such as depression, sadness, a sense of loss and frustration, anxiety, and anger. This is why, even when taking medications or nicotine replacements, many people relapse. Quitting smoking is hard, but not going back to it can be just as challenging if you don‚Äôt maintain some awareness around your emotions and feelings.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-meditation-can-help-you-quit-smoking""><strong>How Meditation Can Help You Quit Smoking</strong></h2> 
   <p>There are various studies on the practice of mindful  and how it can help people quit smoking. Recent brain scanning studies have shown that smokers have less activity in areas associated with self-control. According to Dr. Nora Volkow, Director of the US National Institute on Drug Abuse: ‚ÄúEarly evidence suggests that exercises aimed at increasing self-control, such as mindfulness meditation, can decrease the unconscious influences that motivate a person to smoke.‚Äù Dra. Volkow is trying to understand how our ability to control our desires can be affected by the repetitive usage of drugs, thus preventing us from self-regulating and achieving our goals.</p>

   <p>Dr. Judson Brewer, medical director of the Yale Therapeutic Neuroscience clinic makes a very interesting point, relating the discourses about craving from mindfulness teachers and people who have addictions. Both understand the way that craving something can impact one‚Äôs life: mindfulness teachers talk about how stress is one factor that can generate cravings, and addicts especially understand cravings on a very personal level. In Dr. Brewer‚Äôs words, the standard behavioral approach to quit smoking doesn‚Äôt work so well because it only takes away the symptoms without treating the causes. So, in other words, just avoiding triggers can help, but if you miss them, you‚Äôll be in trouble.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-tips""><strong>TIPS</strong></h2> 
   <p>As stated before, there are many studies and mindfulness practices that can help you quit smoking; it‚Äôs just a matter of trial and error in finding which ones personally work the best for you.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p><strong>Here, we‚Äôll give you some tips from </strong><strong>Dr. Judson Brewer‚Äôs</strong><strong> clinical practice. In this practice, he uses the acronym RAIN:</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Recognize the craving that‚Äôs emerging, and relax into that mixture of feelings that come along with each craving.</li> 
    <li>Accept this moment. Don‚Äôt ignore it, distract yourself, or try to do something about it.</li> 
    <li>Investigate the experience as it grows stronger within you. Ask yourself, ‚ÄúWhat is happening in my body right now?‚Äù</li> 
    <li>Note what is happening. As you note pressure, dullness, tightness, or whatever, it becomes clear that these are nothing more than body sensations. You don‚Äôt have to act on them. You can simply ride out the sensations until they subside.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p>Remember that quitting smoking is no easy task, so don‚Äôt be too harsh with yourself. Meditation is one of the various tools you can use and/or combine in your journey for a healthier life. This can include medication, nicotine replacements, or counseling (individual or in group).</p>

Vulnerability and Asking for Support as Mothers üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Somewhere along the line,&nbsp; mothers have been told they can handle it all. Taking life slowly, one simple task at a time, is often nothing more than a romantic concept, entertained in those few sweet minutes between lying their heads on a pillow and drifting off to sleep. Modern living has started to move quickly, demanding many women to juggle a career on top of caring for their children, nurturing their relationships, and handling basic domestic responsibilities.&nbsp; Mothers have become master-level multitaskers, providing alone what used to be achieved through the cooperation and care of entire communities.<br></p> 
   <p>Since becoming a mother,&nbsp; I‚Äôve seen firsthand what is required to get it all done. To do so, with even a touch of grace, I‚Äôve personally needed a great deal of support along the way. And while the need has varied, depending on how well-resourced each woman is with partnership, community support, and cash flow, I‚Äôve encountered many mothers who felt the crushing overwhelm of this overload,&nbsp; just like me. Yet, what I also noticed, early on, was that very few of them seemed to ask for the help they so desperately needed. It was like each was existing as a self-made island, stranded and in need. Somehow, even though they all whole-heartedly knew in their minds that it does, indeed, ‚Äútake a village‚Äù, I saw a lot of women choosing to suffer alone.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-shame-of-asking-for-support""><strong>The Shame of Asking for Support</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>I started to wonder why. Why was it that asking for support seemed an exception rather than the norm? Why was it usually reserved for those unfiltered moments, when a woman was depleted and at her edge of breakdown, that she called on the support from those around her? Why did women not consider it a necessity to ensure her own well-being? And why, even when I sincerely offered my support to the fellow mothers in the community, was I most often met with an ‚ÄúOh, thank you. It‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm fine‚Äù (when they weren‚Äôt)?&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>As I came up against my own discomfort in asking for support, I began to realize that it wasn‚Äôt personal for any of us. It was learned behavior, where the hardships of motherhood had been normalized. Rather than risk the discomfort of being vulnerable, we‚Äôd been taught to&nbsp; play it safe. While it varies from one culture to the next, a popular modern narrative is that our strength is in radical self-reliance, rather than communion. We‚Äôve been taught that asking for support is an imposition. We fear being pegged as a burden to the people in our lives who have schedules, challenges, and obligations of their own. We‚Äôre afraid to expose our areas of struggle, our darkest places of neediness, and of portraying a less-than-perfect image.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-need-for-connection-and-a-sense-of-belonging""><strong>The Need For Connection and a Sense of Belonging</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>In a sense, we‚Äôve become village-less humans, who‚Äôve forgotten that we‚Äôre wired for connection, and that we find it by allowing ourselves to be vulnerable. Bren√© Brown, a research professor at the University of Houston says, ‚Äúvulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness, but it appears that it‚Äôs also the birthplace of joy, of creativity, of belonging, of love.‚Äù&nbsp; She says humans are here for connection and that, ‚ÄúIn order for connection to happen, we need to allow ourselves to be seen‚Äù. We must know we‚Äôre worthy of connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p><em>As mothers, when we allow ourselves to step into our vulnerability and ask for support, not only do we fill our own cups, but we open the door for others to do the same.</em> In showing our humanness fearlessly, we take the first steps towards true self-compassion and relate from a sense of wholeness to those we love.&nbsp; We model authenticity and show how asking for help isn‚Äôt a sign of weakness, a sign of inadequacy, or a badge of failure. On the contrary, it shows that we can recognize our limits,&nbsp; prioritize our well-being, and acknowledge our own worthiness, even as we‚Äôre managing the needs of others.</p> 
   <p>The hard truth is that, as mothers, we can‚Äôt and shouldn‚Äôt be expected to do it all. We can try, but, ultimately, when we try to do it all, it‚Äôs at the expense of something else. I think it was said best by Publilius Syrus, a slave in the 1st century B.C. He‚Äôs said, ‚ÄúTo do two things at once is to do neither.‚Äù Our human brains are built for single-tasking and haven‚Äôt evolved to process multiple streams of data simultaneously. How can we be fully present for anything when are thoughts are continually fragmented? How can we show up for ourselves and the people we love, when our system is teetering on the edge of burnout? When we live under the constant stress of responsibility and ‚Äútoo much‚Äù, our nervous system never has the opportunity to rest and reset, causing a decline in both cognitive function and a sense of well-being.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-leaning-into-our-vulnerability""><strong>Leaning Into Our Vulnerability</strong></h2> 
   <p>Though, the learning curve has been steep, I‚Äôve realized that leaning hard into my vulnerability is the key to my peace of mind.&nbsp; I‚Äôd like to model, as best I can, what is possible when we‚Äôre able to face it bravely and move through it to the other side. I‚Äôve learned to ask for help shamelessly, as well as how to offer it sincerely.&nbsp; Many times, both my asking and offering are met with a ‚Äúno‚Äù. Still, despite the discomfort, I ask some more. Because here is what I‚Äôve also realized:</p> 
   <p>More than I <em>don‚Äôt</em> want that uneasy feeling of vulnerability, I <em>do </em>want to be a woman that supports others in finding their way back to connection. I want to encourage a worldview that values slowing down over going hard, rest over burnout, and, most importantly, lifting each other up, even when it‚Äôs not easy or convenient.&nbsp; In the short time I have with my son by my side, I want to clear my plate as much as possible, even if just slightly, so we can enjoy each other to the fullest. I know we are both worthy.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>When we begin to walk freely through this revolving door of giving and receiving true support to those in our community, we become part of the change. In a modern cultural climate that perpetuates rugged individualism, disconnection, and isolation, asking for help offers us all an opportunity to foster a sense of belonging. By questioning these cultural values, we start a conversation, and this is the first step in redefining them.<br></p> 
   <p>Women, it‚Äôs time to let out a big sigh, allow your shoulders drop, and ask for what you need. You‚Äôre worthy too.&nbsp;</p>

Overcoming Your Critical Inner Voice As An Entrepreneur üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>It‚Äôs 3:24am and I can‚Äôt sleep. My critical inner voice or ‚Äúinner critic‚Äù is at its best, trying to keep my body and mind awake. The weekend went by so fast. It‚Äôs Sunday and here I am, wide awake, staring at the dark ceiling, thinking about both last week‚Äôs failures and the projected ones to come next week. My inner critic has taken over my mind. How did I get there? Well, within a year, I‚Äôve started a small business, decided to go out on my own to become my own boss, and become an entrepreneur. Now, this little voice is trying to ruin it all. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one in this state tonight. Thousands of you are probably feeling the same right now, sleepless and doing your best to stay positive while your inner critic is bringing you down.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-is-our-critical-inner-voice""><strong>What Is Our Critical Inner Voice?</strong></h2> 
   <p>We all have a critical inner voice in our mind that comments on our behaviour and actions negatively. It tells us things like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre too dumb to do this. You‚Äôre not fast or strong enough.‚Äù&nbsp; According to&nbsp; this voice comes from ‚Äúearly life experiences that are internalized and taken in as ways we think about ourselves.‚Äù It stems from painful childhood experiences or behaviours from referencial adults surrounding us. Firestone says, ‚Äúas we grow up, we unconsciously adopt and integrate this pattern of destructive thoughts toward ourselves and others.‚Äù We then create our own path in trying to avoid and/or identify to this negative pattern.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-lack-of-confidence""><strong>Lack of confidence</strong></h2> 
   <p>My inner critic is a very small, soft-toned, almost discreet voice. It could easily be confused with self-caring and concern. In reality, though, it is judgmental, critical and unkind. This voice is active, alert, and shows up in many ways. It is the constant mental reminder of my many mistakes, as well as harmless comments by others that I‚Äôve exaggerated and turned into insecurities. It is imagining, with overwhelm, every uncompleted task on my To-Do List, yet being unable to start because I feel ashamed or afraid I won‚Äôt succeed in getting them done properly. No matter how many times people say, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll do it right‚Äù, I have a hard time believing it.&nbsp; I struggle to accept the compliments, which are exactly what I need to move forward. Though, this little voice can be very powerful and paralyzing, taking control on our mood and our life, it‚Äôs important to know it‚Äôs just a natural defense mechanism trying to alert you.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-does-it-affect-the-entrepreneurship""><strong>How Does It Affect The Entrepreneurship ?</strong></h2> 
   <p>As you may know, small business entrepreneurs have to wear many hats. In addition to all the services provided, they handle all other business facets such as customer service, marketing, financial forecasts, human resources etc. This requires discipline, as well as the ability to think ahead, be creative, constantly develop, research and bounce back whenever something unplanned occurs. When this inner critic appears, it can slow down or even halt these processes, preventing growth and progress. For example I‚Äôve been postponing a recent project due to my own inner voice assuring me that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to fail. I‚Äôm not ready. This project is silly.‚Äù</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-so-how-do-overcome-this-critical-inner-voice""><strong>So How Do Overcome This Critical Inner Voice?</strong></h2> 
   <p>How do I deal with this voice as it arises? First, I acknowledge its presence and influence. Then, I practice one or more of these following techniques to gain perspective:</p> 
   <p><strong>Name That Voice</strong></p> 
   <p>Identifying the voice is a first step in gaining confidence. There are many ways to identify and acknowledge it. It can be as simple as saying, ‚Äúoh there‚Äôs that little voice again‚Äù. You can also try to find its tone. Is it a high pitch voice or a low voice? You can also give it a name. That way whenever ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù comes to talk to you, you can just say hello and move on. Remember that this little voice isn‚Äôt you. It‚Äôs not real; it‚Äôs your subconscious playing with you. You can just say to him or her, ‚Äúyeah yeah whatever‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not in the mood, Joe, so thank you and goodbye.‚Äù</p> 
   <p><strong>The Red Hat</strong></p> 
   <p>Another way of seeing it is by thinking of someone that you‚Äôve seen many times but don‚Äôt know personally. Perhaps, you‚Äôve seen this person walking their dog, at the grocery store, or on the bus. Imagine that this person is wearing a bright red hat today and that this image represents your relationship with your inner critic. While running errands you see that person wearing the red hat and you tell yourself, ‚Äúoh that person‚Äôs got a red hat today‚Äù, and you continue walking to the grocery store. That‚Äôs it. You‚Äôve seen, noticed, and acknowledged the hat. You said ‚Äúmeh, so what‚Äù and moved on. This is the same way to approach your inner critical voice. Hear it, see it, put a red hat on it if you need to, and just let it pass by, without giving it much importance.<br></p> 
   <p><strong>The Table</strong></p> 
   <p>Draw two columns. In the left column, write down everything the voice says and then write the positive opposite statement in the right column. Then, hide the left column, or fold the paper in two and read the right column. For example, in the left column I can write down, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough for this project.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not capable enough.‚Äù&nbsp; ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve never quit my corporate job.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna fail this business meeting.‚Äù Next to it write, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfect for this project.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm perfectly capable to do this job.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to go back to my corporate job because I hated it and I‚Äôve totally got this.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to nail this business meeting.‚Äù Keep these sentences as motivational quotes. Whenever a negative thought is stopping you from doing a business task or meeting someone important, just repeat the right column, with conviction and a smile, as many times as you need to.</p> 
   <p><strong>The Sun</strong></p> 
   <p>This one is a type of active meditation that you can do anywhere‚Äìbefore going to bed, in the morning or while walking. Start by finding a quiet place to stand up or sit down and, once comfortable, close your eyes if it‚Äôs easier for you. Inhale deeply while lifting your arms from your sides up towards the sky, like the sun. Exhale by pushing your arms down and breathing all negative thoughts away.&nbsp; Continue raising and lowering the arms with the breath. As the arms rise, inhale positive, loving, warm and compassionate thoughts. As they lower, exhale dark, negative and destructive thoughts. Practice this for about ten breaths. Each time you inhale make sure to extend your arms up powerfully to gain control over that little voice. It can feel affirmative saying your positive thoughts aloud on the inhale and making noise when you exhale all negativity. Finish with both hands on your heart, giving yourself love, warmth, and light. This will calm your mind while giving you physical energy and firing up your motivation.<br></p> 
   <p>As an entrepreneur, be easy on yourself and don‚Äôt let your critical inner voice ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù destroy your future business. In entrepreneurship, we need to remember that perfection is the enemy of progress. Mistakes are a part of learning in business and in life. Let me know how you‚Äôve done with these exercises. I‚Äôm curious to know if they‚Äôve helped you silence your inner critic and what you think. Don‚Äôt hesitate to leave comments, questions or requests in the comment section. As for me,&nbsp; it‚Äôs now the morning. After writing this, I‚Äôm giving myself no excuse to postpone my project further‚Ä¶ after a quick nap!<br></p>

How Meditation Can Help Athletes Get Improved Mental Health üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p><em>‚ÄúMental health has got to be the biggest battle I‚Äôve ever fought with, more than any opponent.‚Äù</em></p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This wasn‚Äôt an ordinary man sharing this quote. Tyson Fury had risen from being born premature and weighing only 1lb at birth to being crowned the World heavyweight champion of the world in 2015. Then mental health problems struck. Following a 30 month battle with depression which led to alcoholism and recreational drug use, Tyson Fury eventually re-entered the ring on 2018. He was a brave man to share so openly. This has followed a wider trend where athletes have shared about their own struggles to raise mental health awareness, including Danny Rose (the England Footballer), Missy Franklin (the five-time Olympic Gold Medal Swimmer) and Novak Djokovic (World tennis number 1). Is there a solution to these ? Combining my experience as a High-Performance Sports Coach to multiple international athletes and meditation teacher I feel meditation is a much under-utilized tool to support athletes with their mental health.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Mental Health is defined in the dictionary as ‚ÄúA state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.‚Äù. For athletes, we could extend this definition to also include ‚Äúmeet the demands of their performance environment‚Äù. Mental Health awareness is not only important for their overall well-being but also ensuring they are able to consistently meet the demands they have in their specific performance environment. Often athletes focus on training the body. Yet it is becoming increasingly common for top coaches to focus on the training of the mind too, whether through the employment of sports psychologists or their own unique man-management methods. For example, Maurico Pochettino, the Spurs manager, puts his squad through an intense series of mind-training exercises before last season‚Äôs champions league final (the biggest game in club football) sharing with the World Media that there is ‚Äú superior energy that you can connect with if you have opened your mind‚Äù.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sport has many known mental health benefits but it can also be used to escape mental health problems that are bubbling just below the surface. Imagine sitting with yourself with no structure for a few days. For most of us, this would raise mental health awareness, as we would start to see what is truly happening in our mind. This may also reveal certain mental health problems. Often the athlete, especially elite ones, are so busy with the repetition, structure, and goal-orientation of their schedule that it has been used to bury what is going on in the mind more than the average person. So when things such as injury, retirement or a drop in form strike for athletes, they find it harder to deal with because they have to look at the depths of the mind in a lot more intensity because it has been building up for years. There is a way around this though.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Through the consistent implementation of a meditation, practice athletes can raise their mental health awareness, as well as get numerous other benefits. Meditation acts like a dry-cleaner on a day by day basis for the mind. It gives athletes a time to allow their mind to properly process some things in a quiet space, without the usual pressure of achievement, goals and progress athletes expect of themselves. It is win-win for the athlete. They not only get improved mental health awareness through the space it gives their mind to process and their own understanding of what is going on in their mind but also performance gains, better focus and better concentration that a regular meditation practice promotes.<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">How do you introduce meditation to the athlete though? Well, the first thing to note is that athletes are prime candidates to be committed and regular meditators if you can share it in the right way with them because they already have the discipline, focus, and dedication from their training. You can share it either with a performance or relaxation focus. In regards to mental health awareness, it is best to share it with a relaxation focus, so the athlete can understand the aim of the meditation is to relax and unwind from the intensity of their sport-specific mental health demands. It is a relaxed training for the mind. This results in the meditation being a practice to promote positive mental health throughout the athlete‚Äôs career rather than mental health awareness only becoming a factor when things become a problem, This is a much more pro-active way to deal with this issue.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Overall meditation is a holistic tool that can be adapted to meet the needs of the 21<sup>st</sup> century athlete, ranging from recreational to elite. It is proactive in its approach to mental health. Through implementing a daily meditation practice focused on relaxation the athlete can process things in the mind daily that can contribute to mental health problems and become more aware earlier on to seek medical help if it is a serious mental health problem they are facing. This empowers the athlete and help makes the sport they love more enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

Can You Be Addicted to Meditation? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p> is one of the most functional ways to achieve mental and physical health. Meditation is a rooted practice that anyone can do, and its benefits have been scientifically proven in many studies. It also doesn‚Äôt have strict rules. However, there is a fine line when it comes to how much we practice meditation: too much reliance on meditation can even be harmful to us.</p> 
   <p>Addiction has various forms. We can be addicted to a substance or a certain behavior. A kind of food or even a feeling can be addictive. But being addicted to meditation sounds a little different. Is it possible to be addicted to something that seems healthy to us? And if so, is that a bad thing? Today we‚Äôre going to look at this topic with a magnifying glass.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-a-brief-look-at-addiction""><strong>A Brief Look at Addiction</strong></h2> 
   <p>Addiction is the result of a physical reaction: it‚Äôs closely related to our dopamine, serotonin and endorphin hormones. These hormones are the reason we can feel deprived of a certain substance or behavior, and why we can try to seek more of it.&nbsp; Scientists say that our genes are another factor in addiction, but having genes that are prone to addiction is not a total explanation by itself. Environmental factors and difficulty in our living conditions are also among the important variables for the roots of addiction. Here we can look to Robin Sharma‚Äôs saying in his book, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari: ‚ÄúThere is a fine line between our individual freedom and being a slave to our instincts.‚Äù</p>

   <h2 id=""h-meditation-in-addiction-treatment""><strong>Meditation in Addiction Treatment&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>Our awareness determines our attitude, and whether we act impulsively or not. We can see the things that incentivize us to act in certain ways when we‚Äôre present in the moment and aware. With regular meditation, our awareness within daily life increases, and we can decide whether or not to listen to every voice in us. For example, even if we open the refrigerator door as a reflex, we can be aware of the next action we want to take ‚Äî reaching for the chocolate. Chocolate may seem innocent, but we need the same attitude when it comes to drug abuse or a gambling addiction: we need to be able to see what our real need is without being a slave to our instincts, and activating our conscious decision-making mechanisms. Meditation alone is not enough, but it is an important form of support for controlling our willpower.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Dr. Andrew Newberg conducted a study with Tibetan Buddhists for his research on the neurology of belief. During his study,&nbsp; he examined the brain activity of Buddhist monks during meditation and found remarkable results in the anterior lobe of the brain. The findings suggest that in deep meditation, the frontal lobe of the brain feels joy and satisfaction as though all its desires were met and fulfilled. Similar intense activity in the same part of the brain is seen in substance addiction, too. When the addict obtains what he or she is deprived of, the frontal lobe of the brain feels satisfied. However, over time, the connection between the frontal lobe and the reward-penalty area of the middle of the brain is disrupted. Hormone receptors wear out over time, and addiction can become inevitable.*</p> 
   <p>This effect of meditation causes scientists to ask this question: ‚ÄúIf one learns to operate that part of the brain on her/his own, would s/he still need to take substances?‚Äù The answer may affect all treatment approaches in the coming years. Regardless of the outcome, we know that meditation is a part of many addiction treatment programs today.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-much-time-does-meditation-take-up-in-your-life""><strong>How Much Time Does Meditation Take Up In Your Life?</strong></h2> 
   <p>The benefits of regular 20-minute meditation every day have been proven by many scientific studies. New neural networks are built in our brains, and our awareness goes beyond 20 minutes of practice, affecting other aspects of our lives as well. Through meditation, we get to examine parts of ourselves we didn‚Äôt know before. We see ourselves more clearly, and this leads to transformation. With all these positive effects, meditation draws in many people who practice it.</p> 
   <p>So, when you look at your daily routine, how often do you meditate? 20 minutes? An hour? Or maybe a couple of times a day‚Ä¶ There is no clear limit of course, but there may be the possibility of ‚Äúoverdosing.‚Äù If we use meditation as an escape, then we can call it an overdose.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Meditation and the moments of awareness it creates in our daily life are important. However, being obsessed with meditation and continuously implementing meditation practices may not be healthy for us. Also, if we use meditation as a way to run away from the flow of life, it may be time to try to figure out what you‚Äôre running away from.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-signs-of-meditation-addiction""><strong>Signs of Meditation Addiction</strong></h2> 
   <p>Being passionate about and being addicted to things that make us feel good are two similar attitudes. Addiction is not a healthy state even if what we are addicted to is healthy. But how can this be possible in meditation?</p> 
   <p><strong>Addiction to Meditation Practices:</strong></p> 
   <p>The good thing about meditation is that it can make us passionate. But going beyond this can result in addiction. Instead of confronting the problem itself when we are facing troubles, it is possible to escape to meditation as a way to relax and be distracted. Smoking, drinking alcohol, or eating unconsciously when we have problems is an escape. All these behaviors are tendencies to run away from a problem. If we use meditation for this purpose and use it as a tool to relax, things won‚Äôt go very well. While we think that we have chosen it as a ‚Äúuseful‚Äù method of stress relief, meditation in this state does not bring us many benefits. For example, when you receive bad news, instead of staying with the feeling of the news and digesting what you‚Äôre feeling full,  may escape from the news itself.</p> 
   <p>If your emotions are too high, it is advisable to bring your focus to something out of the situation during meditation, but problems may arise if you only choose to meditate over other actions. If you meditate continuously regardless of the intensity of your emotion, and cannot show flexibility in shifting your attention back towards the situation, you may face problems. It may be healthier to choose to stay with the emotions as meditation teaches you, instead of only engaging in meditation practice when you receive the bad news. You‚Äôre most likely to begin to see the harm, not the benefit of meditation if you turn to your breathing and turn your back on the rest of the world every time you‚Äôre in trouble. Running away from the truth may not always be the best course of action, even if you‚Äôre meditating.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>Addiction to Awareness Moments:</strong> </p> 
   <p>Our brain has two states: the fast brain and the slow brain. Our fast brain is the one that does our daily work automatically and allows us to act reflexively in case of danger. The slow brain is the attitude we learn through meditation and acting with awareness. The following example can help us clarify the difference: a goalkeeper learns how to respond to an incoming ball first by working with awareness. He repeats these hundreds of times by doing the right move towards the ball. S/he is aware of her/his movement and is even able to make calculations. As s/he repeats this, s/he learns which movements s/he will make according to where the ball is coming from, the average speed, and the kicker‚Äôs technique. And during the game, s/he blocks the ball thrown at her/him, not with awareness, but with the reflexes s/he has developed subconsciously.</p> 
   <p>It is possible to be addicted to meditation moments. If such awareness it too good or fun, it can lead to addiction. Meditation emphasizes the importance of moving by observing the body in an awake state. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean we should stay in awareness 24/7 with an obsessive attitude. Here again, we need to focus on the criteria of addition. The dose of the addiction gradually increases with time. The same rule applies to a person who is obsessed with acting with awareness. Awareness is crucial to hear what we are saying in an argument. However, when someone urgently asks for ice from us because they sprained their ankle, if we get into an awareness state and think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm stepping now, now I‚Äôm taking the ice cube tray,‚Äù the person‚Äôs sprained ankle may have already started to swell up in the time it takes us to help them out. Of course, it is possible to go towards the fridge with awareness, if the process doesn‚Äôt slow us down. When someone is obsessively observing her/his movements step by step, s/he needs to see if this is slowing them down or not. That‚Äôs when awareness will be working for them exactly as expected.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-who-has-the-tendency-to-become-an-addict-of-meditation-and-why""><strong>Who Has the Tendency to Become an Addict of Meditation, and Why?</strong></h2> 
   <p>For most of us, an addiction to meditation may not seem possible, but some of us tend more towards addiction. Especially people with an obsessive-compulsive personality disorder can turn meditation or awareness into an addiction. The drive to do things perfectly and repetitively can also make meditation an obsession. The fact that serotonin decreases as a part of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and that meditation is a practice that increases serotonin can be one of the reasons for addiction.</p> 
   <p>In some blogs, we see people posting that they are constantly meditating, and they even start meditating when the conversation during dinner is meaningless. Even the day I started writing this blog, a friend of mine who didn‚Äôt have any idea I was focusing on this topic, told me that she meditates every time she feels bored. In some blogs, people question if this is an addiction or not. Turning towards meditation during a problem can be an escape from or delay from finding a solution, and it can even break the hearts of the people around us. Ignoring them, and turning to meditation obsessively in any way, can indicate a problem. Of course, only a trained professional can give you a clear answer to the question of addiction.&nbsp; But we shouldn‚Äôt forget that even a healthy practice like meditation can be unhealthy sometimes. We wanted to shed light on this possibility in today‚Äôs blog.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As human beings, we all expect our lives to flow smoothly so that we can enjoy being alive. We also believe that for life to flow smoothly, we need to accomplish a lot in order to deserve that happiness. Our mind is like the remote control of our lives; it often believes that life is similar to the light at the end of the tunnel. And the tunnel itself is the route we need to pass through by getting things done, accomplishing tasks, and achieving goals in life. Only after passing through this ‚Äútunnel‚Äù can we start living and enjoying the light. Yet in our hearts, we‚Äôre aware that life is about being.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Why are we only satisfied when children say they want to have a prestigious job?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Why can‚Äôt the kids just reply that they are ‚Äúbeing happy‚Äù and ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-are-you-a-human-being-or-a-human-doing""><strong>Are you a ‚ÄúHuman Being‚Äù or a ‚ÄúHuman Doing‚Äù?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Focusing on the future and bringing our attention to ‚Äúdoing‚Äù instead of ‚Äúbeing‚Äù is a thing we learn when we are a kid, and it becomes a habit as adults. Living in an action-oriented way instead of a feeling-oriented way becomes an automatic reaction for&nbsp; us over time. But at the end of the day, we mostly overlook that connection between actions and feelings, and we live day-to-day, without considering how we feel or whether we‚Äôre really living the way we want.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, who is known as a master of , summarises this tendency towards ‚Äúdoing‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbeing‚Äù as becoming a ‚Äúhuman doing‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúhuman being.‚Äù As he explains in his book ‚Äú,‚Äù nowadays we too used to accomplishing our to-do lists, which are all based on the expectations we place on ourselves.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The ‚Äúbeing state,‚Äù on the other hand, is the experience of the moment as it is. To be in an experience and to be in the now, is to be with your full presence, the presence of your body and mind and heart. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><br>In a ‚Äúbeing state,‚Äù you see how your body is positioned in that moment and what your body language says to you. You see what‚Äôs going on inside and outside yourself in that exact moment. You are aware of the sounds and smells around you. You see all the colours around you and feel the heat of your hands. And you notice the effect of outside distractions on your mental state. You let it all happen without interfering, by simply inhaling and exhaling.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Your mind is simply in the here and now, not digging up the past or planning the future. You just observe and let judgements and thoughts come and go, without following or dismissing them.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You know how you feel in that exact moment by understanding your emotions within the experience.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You let all this happen, without controlling, changing, analysing, judging or trying to discover a certain meaning. You just look at <em>what</em> is happening right now, not <em>why</em> something is happening right now. You understand what is going on with acceptance, with an open heart full of compassion. You just accept all as it is!&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As an adult, I lived in a ‚Äúdoing state‚Äù until I was 25, when I realised that something was missing ‚Äî that I was stuck in a life that I didn‚Äôt belong in.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this period, I reminded myself that all the turning points in my life were a result of me following my passions and desires no matter what.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And that reminded me of the presence of my inner self, which was still there, but hard to reach due to my busy schedule and how action-oriented I was. Back then, checking off the things on my to-do list made me satisfied, but I was hopelessly waiting for the day when my to-do list would be empty and I could finally start living. But that day never came!&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">My spiritual journey started with a reiki practice. I tried out many new things that all</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">contributed to me becoming my real self. I became a yoga teacher in addition to becoming a life-long yoga student. When I encountered Mindfulness &amp; Meditation and could integrate it into my life, everything started to shift. In the journey to becoming a Mindfulness Meditation Coach, I knew that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to guide people through a journey that I hadn‚Äôt made myself. As I developed the habit of living more mindfully and having a regular meditation practice, over time I realised that it was becoming much easier to reclaim the present moment and be in the here and now with all my presence ‚Äî even during the tough experiences.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Staying still and letting everything just happen, letting things come and go, opened a gate to my inner self. Connecting and communicating with my inner child and freeing her from the to-do lists let me enjoy my time and my weekends. Life became much easier but the best feeling was that I was actually started to feel alive.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Since my childhood, I had always been so independent and rebellious towards people who tried to shape me in any way. It was enlightening to realise that one of the strongest barriers in my life was my being very rebellious against expectations of others, but pushing myself hard to achieve my own expectations at the same time. That was the thing that made my life harder. On one hand, yes I was totally free when I was growing up, but I had myself in front of me, telling me what to do.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Freeing up my inner self from my mind and the rules I made for myself was a great moment of awareness for me.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-and-what-will-happen-to-doing-state-then""><strong>And What Will Happen to Doing State, Then?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By the way, living in the ‚Äúbeing state‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do anything anymore and let everything just come and go.‚Äù ‚ÄúDoing‚Äù is just as valuable as ‚Äúbeing.‚Äù Accomplishing your responsibilities, engaging in projects that you love, earning a living in the profession you love, going after your dreams and passions‚Ä¶ these are all needed in order to have a balanced life. The important thing is to let your ‚Äúbeing state‚Äù guide your ‚Äúdoing state.‚Äù That is when the things you do satisfy your inner self, that is when you realise yourself!&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When it comes to practice, here are some key questions you can ask yourself on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>How do you feel today?</li>

    <li>How does this current experience make you feel?</li> 
    <li>What kind of emotions are flowing within you?&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>What are the thoughts and judgements that come and go? Are they real or are they just assumptions?</li> 
    <li>What do you smell in your environment right now?</li> 
    <li>How are outside distractions affecting your inner state?</li> 
    <li>What do you really want to do right now?</li> 
    <li>What is the real motivation for you to do what you‚Äôre doing right now?</li> 
    <li>What do you really need?</li> 
    <li>Did you choose to do what you‚Äôre doing right now, or is it just a habit?</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Once you start to look inside, not with the aim of changing or controlling anything but just understanding with compassion, things start to change. It‚Äôs only when you are aware that you can make a different choice.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Be as kind to yourself as you would to a child!</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Understand yourself, as you would understand your best friend without judgment!&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a parent, it can be discouraging to see your child having a hard time keeping up with school. Oftentimes we tend to feel disappointed, sad or even mad at them, because we believe that they don‚Äôt make enough efforts to concentrate. Yet, there are so many reasons that can explain why a child doesn‚Äôt like going to school, has difficulties to . So, if you ask yourself ‚Äúhow to help my child focus in school?‚Äù, read what follows carefully, you might find very helpful advice to help your kid.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-can-t-my-child-concentrate-in-school""><strong>Why can‚Äôt my child concentrate in school ?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To start with, let‚Äôs see what might be the reasons for your child not to be able to concentrate in school.</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>First of all, it is important to understand that the traditional school system is not easy to follow for every kid. While some have no problems following the rules, keeping quiet and studying when they have to, others  and disoriented. The traditional school system does not take into account the fact that we are all different and that there are many different ways to learn. As a result, many kids have to deal with a lot of confusion and frustration. It might be the case for your child and this could explain why they have difficulties in school.</li> 
   </ul>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Even though we are lucky to receive an education while it‚Äôs not the case for kids of some countries, it is difficult not to feel obligated to go to school. Just take a second to remember: was going to school your favorite thing to do in the world? If you‚Äôre lucky, it might have been. But for most of us, it was not at all! If your child thinks of going to school like a constraint, chances are they do not put themselves in the best condition to learn properly.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Is your child shy? Do you know if they have friends in school? Do they have a hard time when it comes to talking in front of the other pupils to answer the teacher‚Äôs question? Shyness can have a great impact on your child‚Äôs academic performances. If your child has a low self-esteem or doesn‚Äôt know how to act with others, they probably don‚Äôt feel at ease in school, which impacts their abilities to concentrate.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>The competitive spirit we have to deal with in school can be motivational for some students but very unsettling for the others. Students that have difficulties getting out with their studies , especially when they are compared to other students by the teachers.&nbsp;</li>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First of all, it is crucial to empathize with your child. For your relationship to grow in a positive way, it is crucial to put yourself in their shoes. Try to set yourself aside when thinking of what could be the best for them, because what applied to you as a child does not necessarily apply to them today. Listen to them carefully, with full attention and love. Oftentimes, we do feel like we do not understand our children, but do we really listen to them? By not assuming that we already know what our children think, we might be able to uncover details of their personalities we had no idea of. That way, we have the right attitude to understand them and to help them better understand themselves.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Along these same lines, avoid humiliating your child because of poor academic performance. This would only result in damaging their self-esteem even more, and the communication you have with them. Instead, try having open conversations about their performance by showing your understanding and acceptance. To bond with your child, you could talk about the difficulties you encountered when you were in school and the way you overcame them. To be able to learn, we need to believe that we have the capacities to do so. Keep this notion in mind and put emphasis on your kid‚Äôs strengths, even if they are not related to school. Make them realize they have been able to learn something they master today, and make them become aware of the fact that they are smart enough to understand and learn whatever they want or need to.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What could really help a child focus in school would be understanding the way their own memory works. Most of the children have no clue of the way their memory works. As parents, we can help our children understand their memory type. To understand your child‚Äôs memory type, ask them questions to determine it, like the following :</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>What helps you memorize a lesson ? 
     <ul> 
      <li>The teacher has told personal stories related to the lesson (kinesthetic memory, )</li> 
      <li>I took notes and we had visual supports (visual memory)</li> 
      <li>The short explanations are the easiest to memorize for me (auditory memory)</li> 
     </ul></li> 
   </ul> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-can-meditation-help-my-child-with-their-studies""><strong>How can meditation help my child with their studies?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever thought of using meditation for your kids and teens? As you might know, a growing number of schools have started. There are very good reasons for that: meditation helps kids and teens to concentrate better, to develop their self-esteem, to feel calm and to feel good throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We strongly encourage you to do the same at home! If you don‚Äôt practice meditation yourself, this could be a very good occasion to start and to experience peaceful moments with your child, every day. We would suggest starting with very short meditation sessions. This way, it will feel doable and not too binding for both yourself and your child. Here is a list of improvements you can notice in a person‚Äôs attitude, thanks to meditation:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Better self-awareness,</li> 
    <li>,</li> 
    <li>Improved memory,</li> 
    <li>Sense of calm,</li> 
    <li>Sense of self-control,</li> 
    <li>Improvements in relationships,</li> 
    <li>Improvements in communication,</li> 
    <li>And much more.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you think this list of improvements is not directly related to improving school performances, look at it another way. Can you imagine having to learn new information with a sharp attention every day when feeling stressed out? Is it even possible to concentrate properly when you think you might fail and be judged by adults? By helping your child build their own personality with calmness and self control, you will give them the tools to understand their weaknesses and embrace their own strengths. That way, they will find their own balance by accepting who they are and, by extension, improve their relation to school.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So now, as usual, we would love hearing about your personal stories. Has your child had problems concentrating in school and how did you manage to help them?&nbsp;</p>

Understanding your Why üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <h2><strong>Why we need to figure out our ‚Äúwhy‚Äù</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Friederich Nietzche once said, ‚ÄúHe who has a why can endure anyhow.‚Äù Whether you agree with Nietzche‚Äôs overall philosophy or not, this is a point that has been widely acknowledged and accepted over time. This ‚Äúwhy‚Äù that he refers to is one‚Äôs life purpose‚Äìthe internal motivating force that guides and enables humans to navigate life‚Äôs ups and downs and stay on course. It contributes to a sense of meaning and, for many, it is their reason to live.</p> 
   <p>Over the years, many studies have shown that having a life purpose or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù&nbsp; greatly improves an individual‚Äôs mental and physical well-being. It has the potential to reduce stress levels, improve coping mechanisms, and encourage healthier life choices. In fact, an ongoing study of , showed that, statistically, people are likely to have better mind-body health and live longer when they have a clear sense of individual purpose. In another recent study, , likewise, showed better coping strategies and recovery for those connected with their why.<br></p> 
   <p>Research studies aside, for a moment, let‚Äôs consider a more basic example. Suppose you have an important purpose. You want to start your own company or live out your life with the person that you love or be able to take care of your aging parents. Because you have these long term ‚Äúwhy‚Äùs,&nbsp; you‚Äôre more likely to be conscious of your health. If you go to the doctor, for instance, and are told that your cholesterol or blood sugar is too high, you‚Äôll probably eat healthier and start exercising. Having a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù provides you with an important reason to think about your long-term future. The logic is simple: What you want to achieve will serve as motivation for you to make healthier life choices.<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Then how can I figure out my ‚ÄúWhy‚Äù?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Some people live for the sake of a great love. Some find purpose in the work that they do. Others find their ‚Äúwhy‚Äù in living a simple, stress-free life, removed from the constant hum of the city. Because everyone is unique, there are as many reasons to live as there are people in the world. Everyone has their own needs, desires, ambitions, and goals. So, if having a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is important for our longevity and improves our chances of wellness, then how can we go about discovering it? How can you figure out what your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù is?<br></p> 
   <p>Some people are lucky enough to discover their purpose very early in life. For others, it takes a long time. One person might figure this out around college. Another well into their thirties. Yet another after retirement. Everyone discovers their ‚Äúwhy‚Äù at their own pace, in their own time. If you haven‚Äôt figured out your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù just yet, rest assured you are not alone. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that, while you still haven‚Äôt connected with your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, you are in the process of figuring it out. As long as you continue inquiring, you will eventually get closer.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>In the meantime, here are some thought-provoking questions to meditate upon that can help you to discover your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù:</p> 
   <p>¬∑&nbsp; <strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>What inspires you and makes you come alive?</strong><br><br>The word ‚Äúinspire‚Äù comes from a Latin word that means ‚Äúto breathe life into‚Äù. What are some of the things that make you feel as if life is being ‚Äúbreathed‚Äù into you? What energizes you and makes you feel truly alive? As you consider this question, start writing down all the answers that come to your mind. It doesn‚Äôt matter how big or small the activity is that you‚Äôre thinking of. The only thing that matters is how that activity makes you feel.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>¬∑ &nbsp; <strong>What are your inner strengths and abilities? What do you add the greatest value to?<br></strong><br>Essentially, what kinds of problems are you good at solving? What do you do very well?&nbsp; How do you feel like a valued contributor? What are you best equipped and/or able to handle? Start making a list of all these skills, strengths, and abilities as they come to you. In all likelihood, you‚Äôll discover strengths that you‚Äôve been taking for granted and, therefore, didn‚Äôt notice.</p>

   <p>¬∑ &nbsp; <strong> How can you combine your inner strength and abilities with the things that inspire you and make you come alive?</strong><br><br>Now, we come to the crux of things. You‚Äôve made two very important lists: A list of things that inspire you and a list of your strengths and inner abilities. Put these lists side-by-side and see if you can find a way to combine them. What, if any, strengths and inspiration can you unite? How can you make connections between the two? Be patient with your process. As said earlier, figuring out your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù takes time and inquiry. It‚Äôs natural to not see clearly, at first, how to combine something you‚Äôre good at, such as copywriting, with volunteering at a local shelter. The more you elaborate on your strengths and inspirations, though, the more you‚Äôll be able to discover ways of merging the two. The more you discover, the more you can experiment.</p> 
   <p>¬∑ &nbsp; <strong>Will I really enjoy this? How do I know that what I‚Äôve landed on is my ‚Äúwhy‚Äù?</strong><br><br>So, you‚Äôve thought long and hard and found a new way of combining some of your strengths with some of your inspirations. As per the above example, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve been thinking about how you can combine your copywriting skills with an activity that really inspires you, such volunteering at the local shelter. You‚Äôve decided that writing promotional ads and utilizing social media to encourage animal adoption is the perfect combination of the two. How do you know that this is your ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, partly or entirely?&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this question is simpler than you might think: You can‚Äôt know if you don‚Äôt try. If you have an idea that you imagine will enable you to merge your abilities with your inspirations, then take the risk and see how it feels. At worst you‚Äôll have tried something new and exciting that you might enjoy.&nbsp; At best, you will have taken an important step towards discovering a part of your life purpose.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>¬∑</strong><strong> &nbsp; </strong><strong> </strong><strong>How do you want to measure your life?</strong><br></p> 
   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point,&nbsp; there is one final, important question to ask yourself: How do you want to measure your life? Some people measure their life based on how much money they acquire. Others measure their life based upon how many lives they touched and influenced. Still, others base it on the happy memories they have with their loved ones and on how much joy they‚Äôve been able to bring to them. Much like our ‚Äúwhys‚Äù, everyone has a different way of measuring their lives. Understanding how you want your life to be measured, will support you in reconciling your inspirations and skills and move closer towards your true life purpose.&nbsp;</p>

The Mind Divided üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>The human mind is a powerful thing.&nbsp; It can allow us to process all of the beautiful things in our lives, but it can also be a source of suffering. The healthy mind is capable of doing everyday trivial tasks, getting us through our routine and social interactions with relative ease. This is a state of mind that can be easily underappreciated while our mind is at peace. However, when we go through difficulties internally or externally, it can be very challenging for us to perform the simplest of activities like taking a shower, working, or even eating.</p>

   <p>I can‚Äôt say that having panic attacks has brought me any kind of joy, at least not during a crisis. Yet I also cannot deny that without having experienced frequent panic attacks, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have had the motivation to begin meditating consistently.</p> 
   <p>Individuals managing mental illnesses can in fact put forth a lot of energy. While this energy is in most cases destructive, it‚Äôs energy nonetheless. But how can we function in this world and in this life with that kind of energy, and learn to transform it so that it doesn‚Äôt harm us or anyone around us?</p> 
   <p>In my experience, the first step was to observe my mind and realize that it is full of habits, beliefs and delusions. I began to understand more clearly that my mind could shape reality based on those beliefs and, at my worst moments, make me feel as though I was dying.</p> 
   <p>I used to feel like the world was dissolving, and that nothing was solid; as if I could see the air between the molecules that forms all things and people. It was a terrifying visualization and an even worse feeling. Now, because I have a better understanding of how my thoughts dictate my reality, whenever I‚Äôm in the midst of a panic attack rather than exerting energy on wishing that it would be over, I simply surrender to them. Wishing and hoping only makes them last longer and focusing on what an uncomfortable, traumatizing, and scary experience it is only exacerbates the intensity of them.</p> 
   <h2><strong>Focus the mind</strong></h2> 
   <p>Learning to focus the mind can also be incredibly helpful for coping with panic attacks. Most of us aren‚Äôt aware of whether we‚Äôre good at focusing or not, but I quickly learned that my mind was not disciplined enough to focus most of the time. Although I‚Äôm sure this same scenario had happened many times before, I first noticed the power of focusing my mind once while having dinner with my boyfriend at home. We were sitting at the table, drinking wine, and while he had already finished his dinner, I still hadn‚Äôt been able to eat anything. Suddenly, I remembered that this was the same symptom I had previously had, right before having a panic attack. It wasn‚Äôt a conscious or clear thought, but almost as if I unconsciously remembered this symptom throughout my body. It was at this moment I began to take notice of the process my mind went through before going into a panic attack. I realized that noticing the symptoms of an impending panic attack simply made me feel helpless and further exacerbated the state of crisis I felt. And it happened in less than two seconds; as soon as I realized a panic attack might be coming, the emotions linked to being unsafe, in crisis, and under attack quickly reared their heads and it seemed there was no going back.</p>

   </figure> 
   <p>I then began to understand that if I focused my attention on the present moment rather than analyzing what might happen over the following few seconds and minutes, I was able to pacify and in some cases completely prevent the impending panic attack. Of course, as there‚Äôs so much happening in your mind when this situation arises, this was incredibly difficult to do and took a lot of practice, but eventually it began to help. So, it‚Äôs very important to be clear on this point: this practice has no clinical support and I am not definitely telling you how to overcome a panic attack. These are only based on my personal experience.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>The mind surviving in the real world</strong></h2> 
   <p>In spite of learning to practice how to hone my focus, I wondered how I could go out with my husband to have dinner and actually eat something and not have a panic attack. I knew that a crowded place would be too challenging for me, so my idea was to go to an empty restaurant, right when it opened, so there wouldn‚Äôt be anybody there yet. And so that‚Äôs what we did.</p> 
   <p>During that time, a series of political demonstrations were occurring in Brazil. I, with a big passion for politics, had felt disappointed at the fact that I wasn‚Äôt able to join in on this historical moment for my country because of my panic attacks. Yet as we sat there in this restaurant, we talked about our political views and beliefs, we talked about socialism and poverty, and how democracy was such a beautiful thing. I went through the whole dinner not eating much, but nevertheless eating. Throughout the whole dinner, I realized how incredibly focused and present my mind had the ability to be. I realized how powerful my mind is, and how all of those past months of practicing and building a foundation had finally led up to me being able to sit through an entire dinner out without having a panic attack.</p> 
   <p>Even though people had started coming in, I stayed focused on the smell of the food, everything happening around me, and the lively conversation my husband and I were having. From this experience I began to understand how sustained attention and focus needs to be. It‚Äôs the ability to fade out the world around you and keep your attention on the present moment, on one smell, taste, feeling, sound, or sight. I can‚Äôt say that this definition can be applied to a mind free of mental disorders, but for me it was the perfect hour of being: no extremes, no bliss, no suffering, no wondering, just experiencing things the way they were.</p>

   <h2><strong>And then there was bliss‚Ä¶.</strong></h2> 
   <p>There was no happiness or sorrow at the restaurant. Afterwards though, when I realized everything that had happened just during that one dinner, there came this wave of bliss and happiness that washed over me. And in that moment, I was grateful for the suffering and darkness of having had to cope with panic attacks, because otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to feel the full extent of this bliss. Light can only exist because there‚Äôs also darkness.</p> 
   <p>I truly believe that by sharing our experiences with our respective mental disorders, we‚Äôll be able to help one another find ways of not only coping, but thriving in our lives. Do you struggle to cope with any mental disorders or illnesses? Have you ever used meditation or mindfulness to cope with it? What has been your experience and what suggestions can you share with our community?</p>

   <p>Change is scary. For most people there‚Äôs a big fear of change, as we worry about how things will turn out, whether we can cope with the change, and how it will affect the quality of our lives. Buddha is right. When we really examine our lives we‚Äôll notice that although some things may have appeared to stay the same, the vast majority of life can be characterised by change.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p>So how do we work through this fear of change?<br></p> 
   <p>Based on my experience of working with hundreds of clients to help them get peace in their everyday lives (with many having a big fear of change) and my own self-enquiry, I share my three top tips below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Tip 1: Meditate Consistently</strong></h2> 
   <p>This tip has two layers to it. On the one hand it is vital to be consistent in how you approach your meditation practice from a practical perspective. On the other hand, it is equally important to be consistent in what you are trying to tap into internally through your meditation practice.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Consistency breeds confidence. By always having a meditation practice at a set time each day (even if it‚Äôs just for five minutes), you know that there will always be a point during the day in which you can go to the safety and refreshing comfort of your practice. Morning works best in my experience, as it gives you a focus and anchoring point for the rest of your day.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>In addition to this, it‚Äôs essential to tap into the space that can completely deal with change consistently in your daily meditation practice. There are two key spaces in a meditation practice. One is the space that‚Äôs connected to the man-made concept of time, where we are looking to improve, process, and visualise things, while the other space is outside of time and is unchanging (I call this the ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù).&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Change only happens over time. As a result, the fear of change is a time-based phenomena, which simply cannot enter the power and grace of the ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù no matter how difficult life appears to be on the outside. The secret, therefore, is to meditate consistently with the intention of tapping into this ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù space. This space is paradox in action‚Äîit‚Äôs unchanging yet is in everything that changes, and it‚Äôs unaffected by life yet right in the heart of life too.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>The mind can‚Äôt grasp it, which leads me beautifully onto tip number two.<br></p>

   </figure> 
   <h2><strong>Tip 2: Come From A Place Of ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù</strong></h2> 
   <p>Fear of change comes from the fact that our mind is scared of losing control of the concepts and variables it has over what it defines to be ‚Äúour lives‚Äù. This approach is not about changing or controlling the mind. Instead, it‚Äôs a willingness to just let the mind be and set the intention to come from a deep place of ‚Äúnot knowing‚Äù when change arises in your life.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>We are generally so quick to judge a change. Yet we don‚Äôt know whether a change is for better or for worse, or whether this is the right time for change or not. Change is very exciting and refreshing when you simply accept that you don‚Äôt know.<br></p> 
   <p>To help with the practical implementation of this, you can repeat the mantra ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù whenever fear thoughts come up during a change period. This helps anchor you to a vibration which is closely aligned to the power of the ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù. You can also help anchor yourself into the power of the ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù through tip three.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Tip Three: View Life As An Experiment&nbsp;</strong></h2> 
   <p>We often take life too seriously. Yet through the continued implementation of tips one and two we touch something that helps change our view of life forever, as we explore the ‚Äúzero zone‚Äù within the duality and imperfection of life. Life becomes less serious and more like an experiment.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>To help get us into the grace and flow of this state more quickly, we can also start to reverse-engineer this discovery through tip three.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>The process is simple. When you wake up simply set the intention to experiment with things in your life today, doing normal things differently and with no attachment to any outcome. Change up what you eat, start a conversation with a stranger or do something you would consider risky and ‚Äúout of character‚Äù (as long as it causes no harm of course).&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p>The mind will be very resistant to this idea. Over-time, however, it will really help shift your inner posture to one aligned with having no fear when change comes.<br></p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p><strong><em>‚ÄúYou will come closer and closer to perfection, but you will never be perfect. Perfection is not the way of existence. Growth is the way‚Äù (Osho)</em></strong><br></p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p>If you implement the three tips above consistently there is no doubt that something very beautiful and deep will happen in how you approach change in your life. Yet it will never be perfection. Instead it will be a different way to approach the inherent imperfection and chaos of change that gives life its unique taste.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>I would love to hear what you feel about the three tips I share and any progress you make around a fear of change from implementing them.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Chances are you‚Äôve already had your heart broken at some point in your life. I can guess this because going through a heartbreak just seems to come with the package of being a human. Rarely do you meet someone who hasn‚Äôt felt the raw sting and emotional distress of being heartbroken. And just how painful is it to go through those memories over and over again when you know the relationship is over for good? Let‚Äôs say it clearly; it‚Äôs a horrible experience and it feels so incredibly torturous and cruel. And by the way, heartbreaks are much more than just an emotionally distressing situation. We often actually  from the intensity of the emotions we‚Äôre feeling at that time.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In this article, I want to share one of my personal heartbreak stories and my intention in doing this is because during these experiences, the one point of solace I‚Äôve found has been in hearing similar stories. In hearing how much pain and heartache others endured and survived, I too was able to see that this pain too would pass.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-from-a-sweet-relationship-to-a-sudden-breakup""><strong>From a sweet relationship to a sudden breakup</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I will always remember that period of my life, because everything I experienced was so intense. I had recently broken up with my boyfriend with whom I had been for 5 years. Even though the breakup was difficult and painful, I felt free and I knew I had made the right decision.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this time I was also taking boxing classes and that‚Äôs where I met Marc. Marc was so many things at the same time. He was sweet, passionate, smart, strong, sensitive, and very intense. He made it clear that he liked me and did everything he could do for me to notice him. Eventually, I did and I began to learn how interesting he was. We started flirting, but I still didn‚Äôt feel ready to be . I was still recovering from my breakup and knew that I needed more time and space to process it all.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In spite of these feelings, pretty soon Marc and I began a relationship. As I mentioned before, Marc could be incredibly intense in all he was doing. By the time we had been dating for 3 weeks, he had already introduced me to his whole family and his closest friends. He had even invited me to go travel with him to Thailand the next Fall.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Even though deep down I knew that all of this was way too much, too soon, I found myself just going with the flow and dismissing any hesitations and doubts, because after all, I really liked him. One day though, after a month of this very sweet and intense relationship, Marc began to behave distant and stand-offish with me. I sensed it immediately and asked him what was going on. Next thing you know, he broke up with me. He didn‚Äôt have any specific reasons but just lost interest. And that, my friend, is the definition of an emotional rollercoaster ride.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2 id=""h-from-a-sudden-breakup-to-a-deeply-broken-heart""><strong>From a sudden breakup to a deeply broken heart</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, I was far from being prepared to face all of this. First, the mixture of intense emotions from the initial breakup put me in a very vulnerable state. And then having such a sudden breakup for no apparent reason was the final blow. I was devastated. I was dealing with the residual emotions of two back-to-back breakups, and it felt paralyzing. My heart felt as though it was broken into a million pieces and I couldn‚Äôt even think straight.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Do you know this feeling of having been dispossessed of what you had grown to like being yours? That relationship, I wasn‚Äôt even sure I wanted it at first. Then Marc showed me what could be nice about being together, and he made me want it to happen. He did all that to finally decide that he didn‚Äôt want it, after all. From today‚Äôs perspective, I know this isn‚Äôt what happened, but at the moment it felt like Marc had planned to crush my heart. Whatever happened in his head, I was more brokenhearted that I had ever been before. When I finally managed to dry my tears, I realized the strangeness of this very fact : I had been in 2 very long relationships before and it felt like the ending of this one had traumatised me more than my previous breakups. Why was that so ?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-from-heartbreak-to-crucial-understandings-about-relationships""><strong>From heartbreak to crucial understandings about relationships</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When I was finally able to put more distance between myself and the situation and see more clearly, there were some key lessons I was able to understand. Here are three of the biggest insights I learned from this experience:<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-lesson-1""><strong>Lesson 1</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Always listen to yourself and to how you feel. If it‚Äôs not time for you to start a new relationship, regardless of how fantastic this new person may seem,  and give yourself that time and space. You will not miss the opportunity to meet the love of your life because even if this person is so wonderful, you can‚Äôt give them what you yourself do not have.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You will know that you‚Äôve met the right person at the right time the day you no longer feel like you‚Äôre struggling and debating with yourself whether to start a relationship with them or not. , ‚ÄúIf you meet somebody and your heart pounds, your hands shake, your knees go weak, that‚Äôs not the one. When you meet your soulmate, you‚Äôll feel calm. No anxiety, no agitation.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-lesson-2""><strong>Lesson 2</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Be aware of when you find yourself convincing or forcing yourself to reciprocate someone else‚Äôs feelings for you. The mutual attraction, readiness, and commitment must come naturally from both sides. Yet often either because we don‚Äôt want to reject someone or we‚Äôre flattered that they are interested in us, we dismiss our own true feelings and hesitations and try to make it work. Similarly, having to be convinced that a person is a good match for you is a good indication that they probably aren‚Äôt, even if it takes years to realize. This may be difficult to hear, but when a person‚Äôs desire for you to like them is so strong, in many cases it is more likely due to their ego‚Äôs desire to be loved over what they like and appreciate about you. Whatever it is though, always remember this: our intuition is incredibly powerful and insightful and we should always try our best to listen to it, above our ego and rationale.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h3 id=""h-lesson-3""><strong>Lesson 3</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you feel like you‚Äôre being rushed into a relationship and there‚Äôs any part of you that doesn‚Äôt feel completely comfortable with the pace or intensity of a relationship, listen to your gut feeling. You need to acknowledge and express the pace that you‚Äôre comfortable with, without feeling as though someone else is in the driver‚Äôs seat and you‚Äôre just going along for the ride. Always make sure that there are 2 people equally driving the boundaries, pace, and expectations of the relationship.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You see, there‚Äôs so much to learn from every situation we experience and I would even say that the more challenging an experience is, the more opportunities we have to learn from it. What‚Äôs even more essential is for us as fellow humans to support one another through these heartaches by sharing our own experiences. Empathy, , and comradery are such powerful antidotes to pain and suffering, and seeing others overcome the same difficulties you‚Äôre enduring can be incredibly uplifting and encouraging. As we say, what does not kill us makes us stronger!<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So in the spirit of helping others who are currently coping with heartache, tell us about what you‚Äôve learned from your past heartbreaks? What have you learned about yourself and about relationships? Share with us in the comment section below! <br></p>

   <p>One‚Äôs college years are quite different than the other eras of a person‚Äôs life. In those years we receive an academic education on a high level that‚Äôs accepted across the globe, and we get to know a wider environment. Moreover, this environment is probably more free than the ones we‚Äôve known before&nbsp; in every aspect. We can take classes on general subjects or follow our passions through specialized courses. One‚Äôs will and preferences come to the forefront. The way that we express ourselves becomes more varied as we grow. But at the same time, these years can bring negative emotions such as fear and anxiety along with the new and positive aspects as well.<br></p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">  
    <noscript>  
    </noscript> 
   </figure> 
   <p>In college, students often make choices that are influenced by their family, past, and previous academic background. These choices often bring about a very heavy academic load. Tough exam periods, homework, projects, deadlines, and presentations can be very taxing mentally. This level of effort has the potential to make students burn out, both physically and psychologically.</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-academic-pressure-your-grades-are-not-your-truth"">Academic pressure: Your grades are not your truth!</h1> 
   <p>In some schools, evaluations are based on one‚Äôs performance relative to their classmates. Other grading systems may not be based on comparison, but final exams can be quite difficult.. These systems can lead to feelings like inadequacy, failure, and dissatisfaction for students. This may cause mood disorders, specifically depression. According to a study, the rate of depression and anxiety disorders is 15.6% in undergraduates and 13% in graduate students. In the same research study it was observed that the risk of a mental disorder is higher for students who have financial issues. Of course, university education is also financially challenging both for students and for their parents.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Unfortunately, most educational systems are based on a vertical evaluation system where everybody is assumed to be on the same plane. This means our differences, interests, and tendencies can be overlooked. For some of us, written and time-restricted exams feel suffocating. You may have experienced a panic attack in such situations, or know someone who has. In addition, some of us don‚Äôt feel comfortable with verbal communication, or don‚Äôt like speaking in public. Do you remember moments in which,even though you had pages of words in your mind, the second you started your presentation or went to the blackboard, you were unable to even get a word out?<br></p> 
   <p>If you are expected to perform similar to your peers in every field, this is a unique opportunity to find the kind of work you‚Äôre comfortable with and the areas you‚Äôre talented in. Seeing and appreciating that you and the people around you may have different areas of development might be one of the keys to dealing with feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. However, sometimes the fear of being unsuccessful bothers us so much that we cannot see this opportunity clearly. If you are conditioned to the idea of always being successful, the voice in your head that says ‚ÄúWhat if this goes wrong!‚Äù may immobilize you by causing panic in your system. The number of students that feel unhappy when they compare themselves to others constantly is quite significant. We are evaluated by a standardized system, and we attribute negative results from this system to ourselves. If you live within a culture that places a high level of emphasis on grades, you may at times feel unsuccessful compared to those around you.</p>

   <p>Are these feelings familiar to you? Does thinking about whether you‚Äôre succeeding or failing make you feel out of breath from nervousness too? If so, could these thoughts and comments have magnified the situation and become even more intense due to panic and fear? This feeling of being out of breath makes your mind even more confused and inefficient ‚Äî and all the while you have your courses to focus on. And this experience of being unfocused and unproductive may feed into the feelings of failure. Accepting that we all feel like we‚Äôve failed sometimes, and that everyone else has felt like this at some point in their lives as well, is the first step. To break the cycle, remind yourself that you are a unique individual and thatyou exist with your zigs and zags even though these thoughts may not seem convincing to you at first.. We all have the our own rough edges and difficulties,&nbsp; and college life is one of the best places to see and observe this in ourselves and others. Would you seem that ‚Äúunsuccessful‚Äù if you were to see yourself from the eyes of your teacher, friend or family member? Or are you just a student that makes the best effort possible despite having normal ups and downs in her focus and motivation?</p> 
   <h1 id=""h-maintaining-your-individuality-in-your-social-life"">Maintaining your individuality in your social life&nbsp;</h1> 
   <p>Questioning and learning more about yourself is one of the best opportunities you‚Äôll have within the dynamic social environment of college. Since faculty buildings and dormitories are often close to one another, campus life is like living in a small town of students. In fact, interaction with your peers is often more intense than just taking classes together.. For me, it was a very different experience to stay in the dorms when I first moved to another city. The people I lived together with became like my family, and I shared so many good and bad things with them. Many people remember these times with lots of memories, fun, discoveries and and travels. ‚ÄúI wish I could be in college again!, ‚ÄúYou should wander and enjoy yourself before you start working!‚Äù: you may have heard these sentences many times. For example, living in other countries through exchange programs is such an opportunity to experience other cultures while you‚Äôre still a student! Or doing internships in different fields to get to know the business world may make you learn about what you like to do. In all of these college experiences, we have the chance to have a close level of interaction and sharing with those around us.<br></p> 
   <p>In this high-speed environment, though, we also can focus on existing as our person and not losing ourselves in the crowd and social life we‚Äôre surrounded by. Just like in the classroom setting, you may label yourself as ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù when comparing yourself with others, and it‚Äôs normal to feel compelled to do this. Sometimes we adopt the habits of people around us that we look up to. Sometimes we may do things just to fit in. Does it feel familiar to you to be in a situation where you don‚Äôt feel comfortable and are worried about being accepted?&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>All of us, in our lives, want to be seen and appreciated, and we behave according to these desires. However, you may stumble sometimes in this period since these intense interactions and the desire to fit in coincide with the period of transitioning from a teenager to an adult. To expect our thoughts and actions to settle down in this period is not that realistic, though. This age is the one in which we slowly become separated from the support of our family and our old comfort zones. Just like growing up as a kid, watching yourself become more mature and being able to hold your own hand one of the best lessons we can get in life. ‚ÄùSome‚Äù decisions or actions don‚Äôt define who you are. This is a delusion. However, judgements from others may reinforce these delusions. When you‚Äôre young and confused, being affected by one‚Äôs surroundings or judging others is easier.<br></p>

   <p>When you‚Äôre under social pressure, problems may seem bigger than they are. With a mindset that ‚Äúnegative thoughts feed negative emotions,‚Äù, it‚Äôs possible to look at ourselves from a more objective perspective. Talking with people that have been through similar periods may help to see these problems as transitory and as a part of life. You shouldn‚Äôt hesitate to share your feelings with your friends in your close circle. Seeing and understanding that everybody may sometimes feel the same usually eases these thoughts. If you really feel stuck, down, or stressed, you can also turn to psycho-social support. Group activities, art therapy, or spending more time on hobbies can support developing a positive approach by appreciating your individuality.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>While juggling so many activities and responsibilities on a daily basis, searching for your individual identity in college can be tough sometimes, and you can feel like you‚Äôre stretched in so many different directions. But this ‚Äústretch‚Äù is one of the milestones of knowing the world and of starting to get along with the world, I think. We take steps towards being an individual while trying to solve our problems and get in touch with our environment too. Sometimes feeling alienated from ourselves can be included too. They all have a role in finding the balance. If you do not let negative thoughts and fears take over your mind, finding motivation to take positive steps gets easier. While you are young and motivated, nothing is like experiencing college life with all its ups and downs!<br></p> 
   <p>How about you? Have you ever had hard times where you felt worthless instead of appreciating yourself as a different and special individual in college? Do you have an efficient way to deal with this? If not, can you try to be mindful about what you‚Äôve read in this article next time you encounter these kinds of thoughts and feelings?<br></p>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Human beings experience the world through their senses, which are the gateways that allow us to receive information and makes sense of our environments. In order for the brain to organize the input it gathers from our body and our surroundings, and interpret it appropriately, it must pass through one of these sensorial doors. This innate neurobiological process is known as <em>sensory integration</em>.<br></p>

   <p>In addition to the 5 senses in which we are most familiar‚Äìsight, hearing, smell, taste and touch‚Äìthere are 3 additional senses that affect our ability to fully participate in our everyday lives.&nbsp; Occupational therapist and psychologist, Anna Jean Ayres, pioneered research in the field of sensory processing nearly 50 years ago and introduced the terms proprioception, vestibular, and interoception. She posited that, while these senses are designed to support us, dysregulation of our entire system can occur if one or more of these sensory systems has an overactive or underactive response to stimulus. With her research, she developed <em>sensory integrity therapy</em> which included special exercises that had the potential to strengthen the patient‚Äôs sense of balance (vestibular), sense of touch (tactile), and sense of how the body relates to space (proprioceptive).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-does-sensory-integrity-affect-your-health""><strong>How does sensory integrity affect your health?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>According to Ayres, the building blocks of our sensory system are vestibular, proprioception (and the closely related sense of touch), and interoception; each providing unique and specific information to the brain where it is integrated and organized:<br></p> 
   <p>The <strong>vestibular system</strong> supports our capacity to maintain body posture, spatial orientation, and balance. The word ‚Äúvestibule‚Äù means entrance hall or antechamber. It is the antechamber to our brain and is located in our ears. It begins development in the womb and it is the only one of our senses that fully functions at birth. It is vital for survival because it detects motion, initiates movements to maintain balance, and enables us to adapt to our surroundings. The vestibular system is fed through different means such as jumping, spinning, and swinging.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p><strong>Proprioception</strong> is the sense that relates to a connection between our brain and our muscles, skeleton, and connective tissue. It regulates self-movement and body position, allowing one to move freely and efficiently without consciously thinking about it. Activities that require some form of resistance, like pulling, pushing or applying pressure generally involve this sense. Much like our vestibular system, our proprioception needs to be fed in various ways. Everything from our ability to go down stairs without looking or cracking an egg with just enough force involves proprioception.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>The <strong>sense of touch</strong> is closely related to proprioception. We are tactile beings and the way we interact with the world around us is through touching.&nbsp; This act involves applying pressure or force as required. The areas of the body most sensitive to touch are our hands, feet, tongue and lips. Everything is more intense when we feel them with these parts of our bodies.&nbsp;<br></p>

   <p>Finally, <strong>interoception</strong> refers to our connection to the internal physiological condition of our bodies‚Äìwhat we feel inside. Examples of these receptors are the bowels, bladder, reproductive organs and kidneys. It relates to our experiences such as hunger, thirst, the need to urinate, libido, being out of breath, itching, body temperature, happiness, sadness. We are able to achieve an inner balance through interoception.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-disregulation-of-the-senses""><strong>Disregulation of the Senses</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>While the work of Ayres focused on understanding these additional senses through the lens of child development, sensory integrity dysfunction can occur throughout our adult lives. When there is a problem with our interoception, vestibular system, proprioception or sense of touch, we can often feel it‚Äôs effects rippling&nbsp; through our lives. For instance, what we call ‚Äúclumsiness‚Äù is really an imbalance in our sensory system. An imbalance in our bowels will often diminish our inner balance. Activities such as washing the dishes, walking, and dressing all require us to use both sides of the body and depend on our proprioception, vestibular system, sense of touch, sight and hearing.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p><strong>How can we regulate our senses?</strong><br></p> 
   <p>The types of stimuli our brains receive are crucial to the health of our senses. Just as there is a difference between simply eating pasta every day and consuming a varied diet consisting of protein, grains and vegetables, our senses also need different sources of stimulation for optimal health. Tending to the needs of our sensory systems enables our nervous system to function optimally.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>A healthy way to feed the vestibular system, is to imagine types of movement that feel nourishing for your body and practice them when you need  of moral. If you enjoy spinning, spin around several times on your office chair. Allow that feeling to regulate your senses. It‚Äôs also important to avoid movements that you don‚Äôt enjoy. For instance, if you don‚Äôt like jumping, then avoid allowing someone to grab you by the hand and force you to jump. This could potentially harm your vestibular system, instead of helping it.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Proprioception benefits from listening to signals from the way the body wants to move. If you enjoy belly dancing, allow yourself to explore it. It could be your body‚Äôs kinesthetic needs alerting you. Over time, these needs will change. If you pay attention, you may find yourself playing table tennis regularly rather than dancing 5 years from now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-we-have-common-sensory-needs-as-well""><strong>We have common sensory needs as well</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>As varied as our sensory needs are, we do share some common ground with the rest of humanity. When our nervous system is stressed, for instance, certain senses will relax us: a deep sense of pleasure, proprioception, vibrations and horizontal vestibular movements. These four things can help restore a sense of ease and relaxation. Imagine moving your hand quickly and automatically when a dog attempts to bite you. Running away at that moment is proprioception. Trembling in the aftermath, when you‚Äôre out of immediate danger is the body‚Äôs attempt to sooth with vibrations. Holding the area where the teeth grazed your hand and compressing your wound is pressure. Swaying back and forth in that moment is an example of horizontal vestibular movement. None of these things are conscious movements, but are all related to our senses and work together to provide calm.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-listen-to-the-body""><strong>Listen to the Body</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Our sensory system is our guide through life. It gives provides cues to alert us to what we need most. Therefore, paying attention to these signals is a key to maintaining our health. What kind of movement feels good to you? Observe and choose wisely. In time, you‚Äôll notice that life becomes exponentially more enjoyable.</p>

What Can Anger Teach Us? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>In this article, we are going to flip the mirror around and change our outlook: What can anger teach us? While we may be in the habit of learning lessons from emotions that we label as ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù we seldom do the same with anger. Instead, we tend to try to control anger and resist its sway. But have you ever wondered why we continue to carry anger with us throughout our evolutionary process, if it doesn‚Äôt serve an actual purpose?</p>

   <h2><strong>If anger were a teacher, would you sign up for a class?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Throughout our evolution, anger has been one of the long-standing emotions included in the mosaic of who we are as humans. We‚Äôve always been aware of its presence, but we‚Äôve often considered it a bad thing. So much so that Sappho made this observation about society around 650 BCE: ‚ÄúWhen one‚Äôs heart is filled with anger, one should hold one‚Äôs garrulous tongue.‚Äù In 2019, this expression still serves as a mirror for the society we live in. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôll be flipping this mirror around and figuring out why evolution continues to keep anger alive.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Anger stimulates, energizes, and protects us against danger. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs still part of our system. In this sense, anger can be a very functional emotion. Anger triggers a warning signal in our bodies that prepares us to manage an existing challenge, danger, or problem. And in some instances that surge of anger can help us survive life-threatening situations. Yet for most of us, our anger is misplaced and disproportionate to the situation before us. By becoming more aware of how our anger sets off a series of emotional and physical reactions within us, we can better understand what underlying sources of frustration we have.</p> 
   <p>Imagine that you were alive 10,000 years ago. If a hunter cut you off while you were on a hunt, you understandably get angry. The will to live, find food and not starve would have fueled your anger. And a different story would be written in that forest ‚Äî the anger might have changed how you acted towards the other hunter. But does the same logic still hold true when someone cuts you off in traffic? How real is the threat to your life in that scenario? Is it possible that what really angers you in that situation is not being taken seriously on the road?</p> 
   <h2><strong>Teach Me Anger, For I Am Listening</strong></h2> 
   <p>Anger can warn us about problems we may be having. It signals that we have a problem we need to solve. Let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre waiting on a document from your co-worker so you can complete your year-end report. But your co-worker repeatedly fails to give you the document in time. You slowly grow angry towards him. You may create many scenarios in your head where you finally lose it. But what would lead you to a productive solution in this situation: actually acting out one of these scenarios in real life, or trying to see the real reason behind your anger? Could it be that what really angers you is that the delay in getting the document will result in a delay in turning in your report, meaning that you‚Äôll be chastised by your boss, lose respect from him and maybe even jeopardize your relationship? If that‚Äôs the case, where is your anger really directed ‚Äî at your friend, or the anxiety you feel that is prompting you to come up with such scenarios?&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>Anger mirrors our unmet needs.</strong></h2> 
   <p>Anger can also reveal our own needs to us. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve gotten home at the end of a long work day and are looking forward to relaxing with your girlfriend and watching a movie. But then the doorbell rings unexpectedly. It‚Äôs your mother, standing at the doorstep with a pot of soup she‚Äôs made just for you. Of course, now that she‚Äôs here, she stays longer to enjoy a cup of tea with you. There are two contenders for anger in this scenario: the mother who only wanted to support his son but isn‚Äôt appreciated, and the couple who had been about to order pizza. The mother feels the need to be seen and appreciated; she wants to connect with her son. The son, however, feels the need to relax physically and mentally without any social responsibilities after a long day. If the mother and son give into their anger at this moment, instead of controlling it, they‚Äôll inevitably say things to each other that they‚Äôll regret later on. But if they examine what they‚Äôre angry about instead, they can form a healthy dialogue and prevent a repeat of the same situation.</p> 
   <p>Anger can motivate us as well and give us courage. It can push us to take the steps we want to take. It‚Äôs perfectly natural to grow angry when we‚Äôre passed over a promotion that we think we deserve. But neither the other candidate up for promotion nor our boss, who we feel is overlooking us, is to blame. Losing our temper with either of them, when we don‚Äôt even know if there is a guilty party or not, will not help us. But instead, it‚Äôs possible to turn our anger inward in this scenario and examine ourselves. In this case, our anger may push us towards shaking off our hesitancy and meeting with our boss so that we can show him what we are truly capable of.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Another thing anger can do is give us awareness. If your little sibling or child uses the walls of your home as their own canvas to paint, then you might grow angry. But are you angry at them, or are you frustrated by the fact that the walls of your carefully decorated home are now messed up or that you repeatedly have to clean them up? It‚Äôs important to be mindful about what is getting you angry in a situation. Any strong reaction we show to this behavior may not give us any kind of result if we aren‚Äôt sure about what we are angry at. Even if it does, reacting that way may cause harm to the person you are reacting to and to your relationship with them. So, listening to yourself and recognizing your emotions can help explain your point to them calmly. You can express your concerns and needs in a secure dialogue without hurting each other, which enables both parts to find a middle way.&nbsp;</p>

   <h2><strong>Learn from your anger.</strong></h2> 
   <p>Anger can reveal who you are to yourself. What do you want? What do you expect from whom? And perhaps most important of all, why do you need these things? Why do you feel that need ‚Äî what part of your being do you find lacking?&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I remember right after college graduation the first paycheck I received from my new job. I was excited, thrilled and walked home feeling on top of the world. Yet after my first few months of paying rent, utilities, and more, it soon became painfully clear that I was going to have to be very careful about how I spent each month‚Äôs check. And that‚Äôs when it started.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As I began making choices to save a dollar here and there, I was confronted by the fact that so many of my peers didn‚Äôt seem to be in the same predicament. While others enjoyed weekend trips to Miami, weekly blowouts, and daily cocktails after work, I was just excited to splurge on a trip to Whole Foods once a month. Now this article could go in so many different directions from this point, from how to effectively budget your money to the probability that most of my peers were amassing credit card debt or getting financial support from their families. But for the purpose of this post, I want to discuss that demoralizing feeling so many of us have had when we start to equate our self worth with our net worth.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this period, what I found myself constantly thinking was ‚ÄúI must not be smart enough‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not assertive enough‚Äù or ‚ÄúI guess I don‚Äôt have as much value to offer my workplace‚Äù. After all, compared to my friends, here I was struggling to make end‚Äôs meet. Sure I knew in the back of my mind that some of my friends were getting money from their parents while others had a trust fund to sit on, yet none of that seemed to matter when it came down to going out for dinner and being the only one who couldn‚Äôt afford more than an appetizer.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So many of us can feel this same sense of worthlessness and shame around how much money we make because it‚Äôs so easy to tie a number to our value as a human. After all, we do it for most objects, services, and experiences so why not do it to ourselves? We boast of celebrities and influencers who have enormous net worth and praise them as exceptional human beings.&nbsp;<br></p>

There‚Äôs that sense of pride, self-assurance, and empowerment that we feel when we‚Äôre able to afford luxury goods or experiences. Most often that‚Äôs because we believe that by having the capability of affording such a thing, we are demonstrating to ourselves and others that we are one or all of the following: worthy, deserving, powerful, or intelligent. After all, how else could we afford such a thing?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take a moment and think about what first comes to mind when you meet someone who lives in a big house, takes exotic vacations abroad, or appears to have a high net worth. Even if a part of us rolls our eyes at their superfluous lifestyle, the majority of us have an impression that this person must have some extraordinary capabilities to offer in return for the money they‚Äôve amassed, even if that talent is to swindle.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And that <em>may</em> be the case. It‚Äôs also somewhat unrealistic to ever completely detach ourselves from that spark of joy we feel when we‚Äôre able to afford a luxury good or finally get that pay raise we‚Äôve wanted.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And yet, what I experienced early on and want to consider in this article is our value as humans separate from our paychecks, revenues, profits, and net worth.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As blunt and rude as it may sound, the real question is‚Ä¶<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-is-the-number-on-your-paycheck-all-you-re-worth""><strong>Is the number on your paycheck all you‚Äôre worth?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Most probably, many of you are responding with a resounding ‚Äúof course not‚Äù. Yet as much as we may know that in our hearts and minds, consider how much. A father who can‚Äôt afford to buy his child a bicycle, thinking someone is out of your league just because they come from a wealthy background, or realizing that you can‚Äôt afford to join your friend‚Äôs bachelorette party. We can all empathize with this mix of feelings, and in those cases, we are prone to criticize ourselves for not being smart or competent enough to provide more value for those we love.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs important in those moments to become aware of what you‚Äôre indirectly telling yourself about yourself when it comes to . Just a few moments ago you acknowledged that, that number on your paycheck does not equate to your value as a human being, so allow that awareness to drive the conversation happening in your mind.<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h2 id=""h-are-you-defined-by-what-happens-to-you""><strong>Are you defined by what happens to you?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another important aspect to consider when determining our own self worth is how easily we attach what happens around us to our own value and capabilities. So many parts of our environment are completely outside of our control and influence, and yet it‚Äôs easy to allow those variables to serve as testaments to our success, failures, luck, and performance. The country we were born in, the company that had to lay us off, the neighborhood we live in, or how much money our parents have. So many of these conditions are beyond our control and yet we allow them to dictate .<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">More than that, within our own lives we often allow our good and bad experiences to define our self-worth. But think about it. Life is always full of ups and downs; through all of these positive and negative experiences, the one constant is our own being, whose value and worth never changes. One day you could have a great day at work and feel on top of the world, and the next day you could receive devastating news that makes you feel disappointed and small. If we can step back though and see that those external situations don‚Äôt actually have any impact on , we‚Äôll learn to see everything that happens around with less gravity and resistance.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Money, success, praise, and material accumulation‚Ä¶ it all comes and goes. These are all temporary while your being is permanent. Not one of these variables can change your being without your permission. Oftentimes in meditation, we compare ourselves to the sky. Because like the sky we are a vast field of energy in which every kind of weather and cloud passes; yet all of those storms, bright clouds, and thunder pass while we remain just as we are.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After all, regardless of your income, job title, and earning potential, think of how any of those variables affect the love your pets, children, or loved ones have for you.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This leads us to our final question.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This was the question I finally had to ask myself at the age of 23 when I found that I was continuously criticizing myself for not being able to afford what I thought I should be able to afford at that point. At first my mind was blank. It can be difficult to list out everything you have to offer that doesn‚Äôt require any money. Yet over time, I found this to be such a helpful exercise in dissolving all of those self-critical thoughts and feelings of money shame and frustration.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Over the last few years, I‚Äôve used meditation as a way of observing the stories I tell myself about myself and every so often, another self-critical thought comes up regarding money. With the help of asking myself the aforementioned question as well as trying compassion and gratitude meditations, I feel much more sure about what value I have to offer that has nothing to do with how much money I make.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And, in fact, I found that by nourishing my self-worth, I was able to positively influence my net worth. In a later article, we‚Äôll consider how overcoming your self-doubt and criticisms can launch you into incredible opportunities and the life you deserve.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And now as always, I‚Äôd love to hear from your experiences in coping with money shame or separating your net worth from your self-worth.<br></p>

How To Overcome Impostor Syndrome üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all know what it‚Äôs like to fail. It‚Äôs not a good feeling. It‚Äôs discouraging and upsetting and if we let it, it can often drag us down. Success, for the most part, is the complete opposite of failure. It makes us feel good about ourselves. The feeling that our efforts, time and determination is rewarded makes us realize or remember our value. It‚Äôs, therefore, no surprise that we all want to . But there are those of us that can‚Äôt truly enjoy our successes. There are those of us that, no matter how hard they‚Äôve worked will feel as if they don‚Äôt deserve their own success. This feeling is known as the Impostor Syndrome for the very simple reason that most of us that feel that way see an imposter when we look in the mirror. But why is that? Why do we sometimes feel undeserving of the successes we‚Äôve worked so hard to achieve? And how can we stop feeling this way?<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-exactly-is-impostor-syndrome""><strong>What exactly is Impostor Syndrome?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">At its core, Impostor Syndrome is a kind of insecurity. It‚Äôs the feeling that we don‚Äôt deserve whatever it is we‚Äôve achieved and that we‚Äôre a fraud. This achievement might be a promotion, a good grade or the publication of one of our works. At times, we may even feel like we don‚Äôt deserve the kind of life that we‚Äôre living: A good home, , a stable job that we love, valuable friends‚Ä¶<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The term was coined and officially studied in 1978 by Pauline Rose Clance. Clance first defined the syndrome as highly skilled or accomplished people thinking that others are just as skilled or deserving as they are or feeling that they don‚Äôt deserve their own accomplishments. Though a lot of research still needs to be done  and the psychology behind it, over the years we‚Äôve gained a better understanding of what it is and how we might be able to resolve it. Here are just a few ways we can start doing that:<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-having-open-conversations""><strong>Having Open Conversations</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">No matter how confident or successful we may be, we all second guess ourselves. We all have doubts and worries that eat at our minds and can stall us.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúShould I ask for a raise? Do I really deserve a raise?‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúWhy would a guy/girl like that want to be with someone like me?‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúAm I really the right person the give this speech? Aren‚Äôt there more qualified people?‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The problem isn‚Äôt that we have doubts. The problem is that we don‚Äôt talk about them. When we have doubts and insecurities about ourselves and our achievements, we tend to keep them to ourselves. We don‚Äôt share them with our partners, families, and friends because part of us is worried that they will confirm our fears. But in fact, we only hurt ourselves more by not sharing.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we choose not to share our doubts and insecurities with others we not only isolate ourselves, we make it much harder for our close peers and loved ones to share their same self-doubts. The more we have  about whatever it is we feel we don‚Äôt deserve, the more we begin to believe that we are the only ones that doubt ourselves. This belief reinforces the idea that we are not worthy. How could we be? Other people, <em>worthy people</em> don‚Äôt think and feel as we do, after all. This way of thinking quickly traps us in a loop. The more we doubt ourselves, the more isolated we become and the more isolated we become, the more we doubt ourselves.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However, if we were to share our doubts, insecurities, and thoughts with other people, we would achieve two things. First, we would get honest feedback from the people around us and these people that we love and trust would remind us as to why we are, in fact, deserving of our accomplishments. Sometimes it‚Äôs harder for us to see our positive qualities over our negative qualities. So sharing our thoughts in this way will give the people we trust the opportunity to become mirrors that show us the positive qualities that we do have. In doing so, our friends and families can help us to see and evaluate more clearly. This way we can re-learn to see the value we have and stop ourselves from spiraling down the drain of negative self-critical thoughts.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The second way that sharing our doubts with others helps us is that it invites  to share their own doubts with us as well. When a friend that we trust and respect responds to our worries with ‚ÄúYou know, I feel like that sometimes too,‚Äù we suddenly realize that we‚Äôre not alone. We see that everyone, even the people that we respect, admire, and see as deserving, feel the same we do sometimes. This helps us to see that not all thoughts we have define us, which in turn can lend us a hand in stepping away from the kinds of thoughts fueled by Impostor Syndrome.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-self-compassion-meditations-and-practices""><strong>Self-Compassion Meditations and Practices</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Impostor Syndrome isn‚Äôt solely caused by our insecurities. It may also be a result of not . It‚Äôs no surprise that most of us are much harsher critics of ourselves than we are of others. Because of this, we are likely to dismiss our efforts and hard work as ‚Äúnot good enough‚Äù, even if we achieve things that others consider to be great or remarkable.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here‚Äôs a good way to gauge if you need a boost in the self-compassion department: Are you good at taking and accepting compliments? Many of us are quick to dismiss whatever compliments we receive. We do, however, cling to the criticism we get from other people. When was the last time somebody paid you a compliment? When was the last time somebody criticized you? How long did you carry that compliment with you? Did you remember it or did you dismiss it? Do you ever think about compliments that have been paid to you?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now go back to the last time someone criticized you. How long did you hold onto that criticism? How long did you carry it with you? Do you occasionally find yourself thinking about it? Has your mind gone back to it again and again?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Odds are you held onto the criticism that was made of you much longer than the compliment that was paid you. Hanging on to criticism may have been easier than  enough to yourself to accept and embrace compliments. This situation doesn‚Äôt help thoughts such as ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I deserve this internship‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not good enough for this relationship‚Äù. In fact, it only helps to reinforce them and therefore strengthen your impostor syndrome. This is why doing self-compassion meditations can be incredibly helpful to you. Next time you sit down to meditate or find yourself in front of the mirror, focus and meditate on the qualities you possess that you think are deserving of praise. List everything that you like about yourself and everything that you value. Think and meditate on these qualities and reflect on how you have made other peoples‚Äô lives better. Doing so will not only help you to be kinder towards yourself but also make you see that it is because of these qualities that you deserve everything you‚Äôve worked towards.&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:29px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> is an important step towards overcoming Imposter Syndrome. Because overcoming Impostor Syndrome means accepting yourself as who you are with both your good qualities and your faults. By practicing self-compassion and mindfulness, we can catch ourselves the next time we start to feel like an impostor. We can learn to truly hear the compliments other people pay us. We can learn to see our praiseworthy qualities for ourselves. Then the next time we start to feel like an imposter we can pause that train of thought to actively remind ourselves of these praises and qualities. In doing so, we can remind ourselves of our own worth, directly countermanding the effects of Imposter Syndrome.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course, neither self-compassion nor having open conversations with other people can fix our problem in a single night. Both practices require repetition, patience and time. It might not be the easiest thing to do but with dedication and the support of our loved ones we can learn to see ourselves as the unique, beautiful and deserving people that we are.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These are only a couple of ways that we can work to overcome Impostor Syndrome. However there are many more. Have you ever felt like an impostor or as if you were undeserving of something? What has helped you in these times?

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôre like me, odds are you‚Äôve envied people who never get angry. You may have also been surprised that such people exist. You may have tried to understand them, or asked yourself skeptically, ‚ÄúHow can someone like you or me never get angry? How is that possible?‚Äù You‚Äôd be right in your skepticism, at least to a degree. Because it‚Äôs not that these people don‚Äôt experience anger ‚Äî it‚Äôs just that they experience it in a different way.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-anger-management-for-those-who-think-they-don-t-get-angry""><strong>Anger Management for Those Who Think They Don‚Äôt Get Angry</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You might even consider people who claim they never get angry as having had their ‚Äúnervous system removed.‚Äù That, however, is simply not possible. Granted, it‚Äôs possible to have your amygdala removed, if you really want to. Neurologist Joseph Ledoux did just that to a patient ‚Äî but because eradicating only one‚Äôs anger is impossible, his patient ended up losing the majority of his emotions. The patient lost his emotional connection to life, abandoned his social identity and began to lead a very isolated existence. He never got angry, but he also never experienced joy again‚Ä¶</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This story is a good reference point to consider the people who we think never get angry. But then, what is the real secret behind these kind of people?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-are-we-covering-up-our-anger""><strong>Are we covering up our anger?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The most probable answer to why most of us and the people around us don‚Äôt often display their anger is that we‚Äôre all inclined to act like we‚Äôre not angry when we actually are. There are situations when we don‚Äôt want to display our anger, such as when we‚Äôre trying to impress someone, in mixed company, at work, or at a special event. Often, we associate getting angry with outwardly showing our distress and frustration. So, we perceive anger itself as a bad thing and hide how we feel. Is that what ‚Äúnot getting angry‚Äù is though? Is the secret to managing our anger learning how to wrap our angry emotions in gauze and hide them away? Do our edges automatically soften when we do so?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We may appear to be very gentle in these scenarios but in reality we‚Äôre building giant towers of anger inside ourselves. In the end, we either let our anger explode with the slightest provocation or we keep it hidden and continue to let it fester. Both options are very unhealthy for our mental and physical wellness. Think about the last time you suppressed your anger for a long period of time; did it simply dissolve away or did it continue to feel heavier and more bothersome?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-could-low-expectations-be-the-answer-to-not-getting-angry""><strong>Could low expectations be the answer to not getting angry?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Those of us who are part of a group of friends often know someone who never seems to gets angry. These are very ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù individuals who often have very low expectations ‚Äî the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt seem to flinch no matter what gets thrown their way. We may describe them as ‚Äúchill‚Äù, ‚Äúdown to earth‚Äù, or someone who ‚Äúgoes with the flow‚Äù. But do they really not feel anger? Not even a tiny little seed of resentment and frustration somewhere deep down? Or is the anger they experience so minimal that we just don‚Äôt see it? In all likelihood, it‚Äôs the latter, for they experience anger in lesser degrees than others normally do due to their lowered expectations and acceptance of things not always happening the way they want them to.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-emotional-problems""><strong>Emotional Problems</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The biggest emotional and psychological problem that many of us face today is depression. Depression can manifest itself in many different ways. Though for many of us, when we‚Äôre in the depths of our depression, we have a tendency to become withdrawn and distance ourselves from what we‚Äôre really feeling and experiencing. It seems as though we‚Äôre numb and unresponsive to what‚Äôs happening around us, whether positive or negative. And it‚Äôs not just anger that we miss out on while in this state: we also miss out on happiness, joy, and surprise. Being numb to our emotions isn‚Äôt a selective process; we cannot only numb our pain, anger, and sadness without also numbing our potential to feel joy, love, and connection.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-all-roads-lead-to-awareness""><strong>All Roads Lead to Awareness</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you consider yourself to be someone who doesn‚Äôt experience feelings of anger often, it may be possible that one of the above three situations applies to you. And yet I want to stress, there is no shame in acknowledging how we cope with our anger. All of us use coping mechanisms to manage uncomfortable emotions.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What meditation and mindfulness allows us to do, though, is to become aware of those uncomfortable emotions and own them. Yes, own them. We are capable of experiencing a whole range of emotions, including anger ‚Äî provided that we don‚Äôt have our amygdala removed ‚Äî and we all are on a journey in learning how to manage them. So let‚Äôs do a recap of some of the most common ways we should avoid suppressing our anger:</p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>You don‚Äôt always need to mask your anger. As you begin to learn better ways of communicating your frustrations and sources of anger, you‚Äôll find that there‚Äôs a way to effectively convey your emotions without hurting others, being violent, or even yelling. Moreover, as we learn those techniques and begin to apply them with those around us, we‚Äôll be pleasantly surprised to find that people aren‚Äôt as put off by someone‚Äôs anger as they are the way they demonstrate it.</li> 
    <li>Regarding expectations: you don‚Äôt have to have bigger and higher expectations than you do now if you don‚Äôt want to. This is entirely your choice. But does the fact that you‚Äôre a gentle person mean that you never get angry? Do you never feel angry in your core, or do you find anger to be unnecessary? Living a peaceful life does not mean never experiencing anger. You can make room for anger, even when you‚Äôre at peace.&nbsp;</li> 
    <li>For those of us who experience depression, we can be more mindful of the fact that our state of mind can oftentimes mask and numb our emotions, including anger. So if you feel as though you never feel angry and know yourself to be coping with depression, you may want to start peeling back the layers of how you acknowledge and deal with your emotions.</li> 
   </ul>

   <h2 id=""h-awareness-and-meditation""><strong>Awareness and Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs another group of people that often create the impression that they don‚Äôt easily get angry. These are people who have become aware of their own emotions by meditating regularly. We can never expect to not experience situations that spark frustration and anger within us, but with mindfulness and meditation practice, we can learn how to live through those experiences with integrity, clarity, and a sense of calm.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is because meditation keeps us present and more aware of our experiences in the moment, as it‚Äôs happening. It helps us to notice what we‚Äôre about to do, before we do it, regardless of whether that‚Äôs saying something hurtful or raising our hand against someone. As you continue to practice meditation and reflect on how you react to anger, you‚Äôll also start to learn how to catch yourself in the moment and make small changes in how you react and process your anger.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And now, we‚Äôre turning over the conversation to you! Do you ever find yourself masking your anger? Or perhaps you live by the motto that with low expectations, you won‚Äôt feel angry as often. If you experience depression, how does that impact how you feel anger?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Finally, would you have advice on how to better manage feelings of anger?</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I‚Äôve had panic attacks since I was 16 years old, so when I met my first husband at age 19 this was already a part of my life and continued on as we dated, got engaged, and eventually married. During this I never really learned how to cope with my panic attacks in an effective way and it was after our actual wedding that I had what I would call a very difficult break down that took me a little over a year to recuperate from. During that year I didn‚Äôt know what to do with myself, much less what my husband needed to do to support me. That‚Äôs why years later, as I am now in a much healthier mental space, I want to share my experience with other couples who are coping with the same problems. Here I want to share some approaches and perspectives that may help partners better support a partner dealing with . <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-losing-a-partner-to-panic-attacks-and-anxiety""><strong>Losing a partner to panic attacks and anxiety.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this one year period of time after my breakdown, I felt incredibly fortunate to have a very supportive and dedicated family and group of friends. Yet of course, the biggest burden was on my husband, especially because we were very young.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I needed time and space and this was very challenging to get as we were newly married and now living together. My partner needed love, attention, romance, and communication, and I was instead withdrawn and in need of solitude.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Although I was still there physically, I can now see that my partner felt as though he had lost his wife. The dynamic which we once had was gone. He was suddenly without his companion, the one he laughed with, planned trips with, and had long conversations with. There was no more going out to dance, watching movies, having sex, or goofing around; I was paralyzed and because of this, I would say that my partner lost as much as I did.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-in-sickness-and-in-health-but-for-how-long""><strong>In sickness and in health, but for how long?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During this time, I began taking some very strong medications that essentially made me into a vegetable. I felt numb, and found it difficult to think about anything, let alone have a fruitful conversation. My husband would come home from work and ask me how my day was and the best I could do was answer with: fine, yes, no, maybe‚Ä¶ This dynamic between us and this journey within myself lasted for almost a year and I know that during that time, my husband was at a complete loss for what to do.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I can‚Äôt speak on behalf of him, though I can understand that he didn‚Äôt see the woman he fell in love with anymore. I know what it feels like to look at your life and feel like things will never get better, that they‚Äôll never change, so I understand why he finally made the decision to leave the marriage. We all have our limits and whether I agreed with him or not, he hit his.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">At the end of the day, as someone who suffered from mental health challenges, our partners are the ones who suffer the most in these situations, because they‚Äôre the ones who spend the most time trying to take care of us. It‚Äôs like having someone but not having them at the same time. It‚Äôs wanting to share things and not being able to, it‚Äôs having to deal with odd situations all the time, like going to a restaurant and having to leave because the smell of the food makes me sick. It‚Äôs not being able to travel, it‚Äôs wanting to have sex and noticing the odor of medicine being excreted from my body. It‚Äôs constantly watching and seeing but never being seen.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-love-without-conditions""><strong>Love without conditions.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">After we divorced, I missed having a partner and someone to love, but at the same time I was afraid of putting another person in that position again. I didn‚Äôt know if I could bare to see that disappointed look on someone‚Äôs face over and over again. I felt wracked with guilt every time I had to say no, every time I couldn‚Äôt do something that I used to enjoy doing with my partner.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, if I can give some advice to those whose partners are currently dealing with mental health challenges, the first thing I would recommend is trying not to pressure your partner. During these times, for your partner, just being able to breath feels like a miracle. To know that you‚Äôll be there by their side is more than enough. Your smile is enough, your presence is enough, and for them not to feel like they have to do anything or be anything to still be loved is all they need. Not having the pressure that they need to please you and not disappoint you is the best gift you could give them during these times.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Of course I know that‚Äôs much more difficult than it sounds; there‚Äôs no manual that guides us on how to act when our partners are managing these problems, yet there‚Äôs also no guilt on either side.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-3-considerations-for-supporting-your-partner-through-panic-attacks""><strong>3 Considerations for Supporting Your Partner Through Panic Attacks</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each person is different and each panic attack is different, yet there are some things that you can do to help your loved one through these times.<br></p> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-keep-communication-open-and-shame-free""><strong>1)</strong> <strong>Keep communication open and shame-free</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A lot of the fear and frustration that you feel watching your partner turn into someone you don‚Äôt recognize can come from not understanding what‚Äôs happening. That being said, trying to ask a bunch of questions to your partner may result in even more frustration as oftentimes your partner will not be quite sure what‚Äôs happening to them either. So in the moment, acknowledge that they feel scared or threatened by something and continue to reassure them that  and that their body will soon find its balance again. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During other times you can rely on outside sources, seek out advice from forums and blogs, and most importantly, accept that you may not always get the answer you want. Sometimes there is no quick fix or solution that can suddenly make all of your partner‚Äôs problems go away. Simply keep the lines of communication open with your partner without shaming them, blaming them or shutting them down. </p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-create-a-comfortable-environment""><strong>2) Create a comfortable environment</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When your partner feels a panic attack coming on, help them find a comfortable position, whether it‚Äôs seated, lying down, or walking. Ask them if they feel hot or cold, because helping to regulate their temperature can be very helpful in reducing the intensity of the attack. Another consideration to be aware of is the lighting. It may sound odd though sometimes too much or fluorescent lighting can also increase the intensity of the panic attack.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <h3 id=""h-3-help-your-partner-focus-on-something""><strong>3) Help your partner focus on something</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the middle of a panic attack, it can feel like the world is closing in on you, or like you‚Äôll suffocate or drown, so it‚Äôs important to help your loved one focus on something outside of themselves. Physical objects or views are easier as it is outside of their own bodies and can provide a kind of grounding feeling. If you‚Äôre in a public place, they can try focusing on the feeling of their feet on the ground, or the sensation of gripping the chair they‚Äôre sitting in. If you‚Äôre in a more controlled environment like your house or car, you can do  together. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Again my intention is to help partners supporting their loved ones through panic attacks. I know that every story is different, every marriage is different and my story is not a ‚Äòone size fits all‚Äô manual, but maybe you can find some comfort in knowing you‚Äôre not alone. I think it‚Äôs important to support others who are dealing with the same issues so now it‚Äôs your turn to share your advice and wisdom.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you been in a similar situation? How was it for you? Did you do some of the things I suggested or do you have your own way of dealing with this to share with us? Thank you!<br></p>

   <p>These little details that I‚Äôve presented about myself may appear to be random. But they are, in fact, connected to each other in the context of the sensory makeup of my body. All the things I‚Äôve listed are related to my sensory system in one way or another and all of these senses then shape my preferences.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>Our senses shape our lives</strong></h2> 
   <p>In school, most of us learned that we had 5 senses, but science tells us otherwise. Sight, smell, touch, hearing, and taste are of course among our primary senses. But other senses can be added to the list including: the vestibular system, proprioception, and interoception.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>The vestibular system makes up our sense of balance and spatial perception. For instance, this sense makes us capable of being able to feel and understand that we‚Äôre riding in an elevator even when our eyes are closed. Proprioception is being able to tell where we feel something in or on our bodies without having to look at it. For example, the aches and pains we feel in our bodies after a heavy workout is an example of proprioception.</p> 
   <p>Interoception, on the other hand, relates to our bowels. This includes our bowel movements, feeling of happiness, allergic reactions, and even times when we‚Äôre feeling that intuitive hunch about something.<br></p> 
   <p>So how can being aware of our eight senses be beneficial to us? Well, as we start to better understand that our individual senses determine our preferences, we will also begin to realize that we don‚Äôt have all that much control over our senses. This acknowledgement can help us be more compassionate and understanding not only of ourselves but others. That means that perhaps when others act on or express preferences contrary to our own, rather than taking it personally, we can simply understand that their senses are different from our own.<br><br>Of course, we can‚Äôt weigh all of our actions and in a mechanical and logical manner. But being able to see the reasons behind various actions, even if only partially, will help us calm ourselves when we need to.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>Pay attention to your senses</strong></h2> 
   <p>Being able to see the needs of our senses allows us to live a more comfortable life. Our senses don‚Äôt simply come out and say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your proprioception and right now I need stimulation‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your vestibular system and I need to be fed‚Äù. Instead, they encourage us to play tennis or jump into a children‚Äôs ball pit. The temptations and desire we feel to partake in such activities are clear marks of our proprioception and vestibular system.</p> 
   <p>We‚Äôve said that proprioception accounts for how we sense our bodies, and our muscles and bones are included in this system. Consider body builders for a moment. The reason they feel such a rush of endorphins and invigoration is because their proprioception craves these intense workouts. Even those grueling and exhausting workouts can feel so satisfying and energizing for these individuals. So, if there‚Äôs anyone around you that you think spends too much time in the gym, consider the situation from this angle.<br><br>Now let‚Äôs go back to our vestibular system. Certain kinds of movements regulate this system such as jumping, spinning, or swaying from side to side‚Ä¶ Personally, I can‚Äôt even picture myself spinning around and around. The image itself is enough to make me feel nauseous. Jumping up and down or swinging on a swing, however, are very enjoyable and calming for me.</p> 
   <p>What about with you? What kinds of movements and actions feel good to you? You may enjoy roller coasters, for example, but your friend may find this to be very unpleasant. Why? Because their vestibular system does not enjoy this sensation.</p> 
   <p><br>It may take practice to view the senses from this perspective. We‚Äôve been acquainted with our five senses since we were kids, learning how to rely on our hearing, smell, sight, and the like. But going beyond these five senses can change our outlook on life.</p> 
   <p>How? Let‚Äôs say you prepared a great breakfast for you and your friends. You really put in a lot of effort and even got all of those fancy cheeses and fruits to include in the spread. And yet, one of your guests hardly touches any of the fruits and cheeses, and you feel a bit annoyed by this.<br>Yet think of a food you don‚Äôt like; something that really doesn‚Äôt get along with your taste buds. In a moment like this, can you consider that your guests‚Äô senses simply did not find the food appealing and that it has nothing to do with you, your hospitality, or your ability to cook? Think of all of the situations similar to this, big and small, that we allow to offend and upset us. Most of the time it‚Äôs not because of any personal grievance or issue someone else has with you, but rather a reflection of their own senses and preferences.</p> 
   <p>How would you like to respond to situations like this in the future?</p>

   <h2><strong>Our senses bring us closer to understanding and compassion</strong></h2> 
   <p>Because our sensory needs shape our preferences, something that‚Äôs very normal for us may seem abnormal to someone else. The opposite may happen as well, leading us to believe that the person before us doesn‚Äôt take us into account when making certain choices.<br><br>But if we embrace compassion, we can stop ourselves from turning our personal perceptions into our automatic behaviors. Everyone‚Äôs senses operate at a different level, meaning that everyone‚Äôs needs are different. While this may sound pretty obvious, think of your day to day life and how often you find yourself feeling flustered or annoyed by someone else‚Äôs lifestyle or preferences? It‚Äôs a burden we place on ourselves to take such preferences as personal attacks on our own way of living.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Take a look at the world around you, including yourself. But this time, try to do it from this new perspective. Do you think you can approach the people around you with more understanding and compassion as you rediscover yourself?</p>

Does Meditation Really Mean Shutting Off Your Toughts? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <h2 id=""h-is-it-possible-to-pause-the-mind""><strong>Is It Possible To Pause the Mind?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Have you ever tried to stop breathing? Or tried to not blink for longer than 30 seconds? Actually, here‚Äôs a more basic example that all of us are familiar with: What does it feel like to have to go to the bathroom but not be able to? Now consider this: What does it mean to stop your thoughts?<br></p> 
   <p>Every organ in your body has a specific function. They keep us alive and ensure our existence in some way. So trying to stop the function of a major organ is to impede life itself. , our stomachs to digest our food, our hearts to distribute vital blood and oxygen to our bodies, and our minds to think‚Ä¶</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-don-t-resist-just-let-go""><strong>Don‚Äôt resist, just let go</strong></h2> 
   <p>That‚Äôs important to keep in mind when we consider practicing  because meditation is an endless path where we strive for effortlessness. Picture it like this; instead of driving in a car and watching the scenery go by, meditation is more like sitting still on a bench and watching the people, cars, birds, and clouds pass by. In doing so, we observe what passes through our minds and come to understand that stopping our minds and quieting them are two different things.<br></p> 
   <p>It is possible to stop your thoughts, but doing so would require a great effort. Our minds generate between 60,000 and 70,000 thoughts per day ‚Äî &nbsp;so it would seem futile to pause such a hardworking organ. Trying to stop our own thoughts would require resistance on our part, but it‚Äôs not resistance we seek through meditation. Instead, we‚Äôre trying to cultivate serenity and effortlessness. In any case, trying to do something doesn‚Äôt always mean we‚Äôll be able to. This phenomenon is something we‚Äôve all experienced in our daily lives. The same holds true for our minds: there‚Äôs no pause button we can press. So, we shouldn‚Äôt waste our time looking for it. </p> 
   <p>Our minds can be exhausted after working hard, almost non-stop the whole day. We can learn to notice its weariness through mindfulness. When we say ‚Äúmindfulness,‚Äù we mean realizing that our minds are a part of our bodies, just like our other organs. It means understanding that we are not our minds and that our minds are just doing its job, just like all our other organs. Having this awareness can change a lot in our lives. <br></p> 
   <p>Understanding that our minds are separate entities doesn‚Äôt mean that they are independent of us. After all, our minds are one of the most important building blocks that make us who we are. But we tend to think that we are solely our minds. This isn‚Äôt true. We can begin to realize this by learning to ‚Äúsee‚Äù our minds and observing our own thoughts. Once we do that, we can give our mind the care and attention it needs. For instance, we can notice when it‚Äôs exhausted. Think of it this way: we are not our fingers. When our fingers are tired of typing, we let them rest. And since we are not our minds either ‚Äî we should let it rest as well.</p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">

   </figure> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-resting-mind""><strong>The resting mind</strong></h2> 
   <p>When we meditate, we examine our minds. We watch the cars that drive by with the same wonder we used to feel as little kids. We see cars of all different colors and shapes, and we continue to watch them pass by. We refrain from making any comments as we watch. We neither criticize the colors that we see nor judge the shapes. If we were to make any such comment, it would be as though we got up and followed one of the cars that passed us by. But our goal is to just sit down and watch. That‚Äôs what our minds need to rest: observation.<br></p> 
   <p>When we meditate, in addition to resting, we also strengthen our minds. After all, it‚Äôs very noisy and restless in our minds. Consider how tired our minds must be: 70,000 &nbsp;thoughts per day! Because of this, our mental muscles need to rest and gather strength. We can strengthen our bodies with physical exercise every day. Why shouldn‚Äôt we do the same for our minds with meditation?<br></p> 
   <p>Trying to stop the flow of thoughts is an exhausting battle. The more we try, the more we‚Äôll wear ourselves out. Finally, we‚Äôll probably decide that we can‚Äôt meditate and maybe even give up. So let‚Äôs all agree on one thing: it‚Äôs not possible to stop the flow of our thoughts. All we can do is slow them down and calm them down.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-should-we-channel-our-energy-towards""><strong>What should we channel our energy towards?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>We know that we can‚Äôt rid our minds of thoughts when we meditate. Instead, we can simply try to understand what types of thoughts our minds generate. We peer into parts of our minds we hadn‚Äôt looked at before. We encounter new things. We can do this by observing without judging, as well as by paying attention.<br></p> 
   <p>Trying to stop our thoughts requires taking action. It‚Äôs tantamount to a battle. Such a battle requires a great deal of energy. We can‚Äôt speak of serenity and rest in meditation if there‚Äôs  involved.</p> 
   <p>If we start to follow a certain thought, we risk getting lost. If we do this, it‚Äôs equivalent to getting up and running after that thought without even paying attention to where we‚Äôre going. Following just one train of thought requires us to take action and expend energy that we didn‚Äôt want to expend in the first place.</p> 
   <p>When we focus on observing our thoughts instead, all we have to do is sit down and watch. It doesn‚Äôt require us to take action. If we do this, we can spend less energy for a longer period of time. We can experience what it is to ‚Äújust be,‚Äù which is the essence of what meditation teaches us.<br></p>

   <p>It‚Äôs possible to momentarily pause our minds. We can stop certain thoughts in their tracks, especially in difficult, stressful times. But this is neither sustainable nor beneficial for us. What we‚Äôre doing with meditation is exploring ourselves, resting, and strengthening our minds. If we want to be in the moment during meditation and be more mindful in general, we need to spread it throughout the rest of our lives. So, focus on new discoveries and see what results from them‚Ä¶ Real change happens when we discover ourselves, not when we pause our minds.</p>

The Making of an Emotionally Available Father üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>On this Father‚Äôs Day, we at Meditopia wanted to discuss a topic that we believe is more relevant than ever to fathers all over the world. In recent years and in many parts of the world, fathers have started to take on a bigger role in the management of the household and child-rearing responsibilities. With this transition, just as the expectations around the role of a mother have evolved, . Part of this change has involved an ever-growing expectation for fathers to be more emotionally involved, vulnerable, and open within their families and communities. Yet these expectations are met with many challenges we all must help to change.<br></p> 
   <p>On behalf of our brothers, sons, fathers, and friends, we need to acknowledge and work through the culture of shame that stunts men‚Äôs ability to be more emotionally involved and vulnerable within their family structure.<br></p> 
   <p>In this article, we‚Äôll discuss some of the main sources of fear and shame men often experience and consider how this prevents them from being able to be more vulnerable, empathetic, compassionate, and loving. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-emotional-control-work-comes-first-status-and-violence""><strong>Emotional control, work comes first, status, and violence.</strong></h2> 
   <p>These are the character traits that were shown to be most prominent in how men feel they must adhere to gender norms and expectations in society. This study done by  highlights the different gender role norms and brings to light what we have all witnessed and even perhaps participated in throughout our lives. And just in case you were curious, the main character traits women generally feel obliged to follow were: be nice, thin, modest, and use all available resources for appearance. Strikes an uncomfortable nerve doesn‚Äôt it?<br></p> 
   <p>Think about the men and boys in your life. Do you think that any of them feel the pressure to always remain emotionally stoic, no matter how fearful, heartbroken, or unsure they may feel? The whole family can fall apart, but the men and boys must stay strong, be tough, and guard their families from further distress and pain. They should be the all-knowing, all-fixing, ‚Äòhold-down-the-fort‚Äô handymen of the family. Sound familiar? That‚Äôs because there‚Äôs still a deep-seated expectation for men to never show weakness or uncertainty. And in a world where vulnerability is still often perceieved as weakness, we can then never expect men to prioritize reason over honor, authenticity over reputation, uncertainty over control, and integrity over status.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-boys-will-be-boys-but-what-about-girls""><strong>Boys will be boys, but what about girls?</strong></h2> 
   <p>An on-going study by  revealed that many men are feeling this expectation to be more emotionally vulnerable and open with their partners and family. Yet even in delivering on this expectation, . In several interviews there were comments like, ‚ÄúI pretend to be vulnerable, but I keep it under control,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI give her enough to believe I‚Äôm being open because if I were totally truthful about how afraid or out of control I feel, she would judge me.‚Äù Brown went further to reveal that most men and boys she interviewed didn‚Äôt feel this way because of the pressure they got from their bosses, friends, coaches, or even colleagues. The resounding answer they gave when asked from whom they felt the most pressure to be strong, physically fit, financially sound, and secure was: <em>women</em>.<br></p> 
   <p>As I read through the comments made by several men, I was hit with a flood of instances in which I had witnessed the exact behaviors they were describing. But truthfully, I had always somewhat dismissed men‚Äôs problems, comparing them to the mountain of injustices and challenges women face. Though as I continued to read Brown‚Äôs , I realized that not only is it narrow-minded and unfair to compare one person‚Äôs shame and fears to another‚Äôs. In this particular case, by trivializing the feelings and challenges men face, I was not only exacerbating the patriarchal system which limited my own interests, but avoiding a conversation that I as a woman so vehemently demanded on behalf of my gender group.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-from-boys-to-men-to-fathers""><strong>From boys, to men, to fathers.</strong></h2> 
   <p>Think about the instances when you‚Äôve witnessed or participated in reinforcing these limiting gender norms. Making fun of a guy for having no sense of direction, assuming the guy in the group would know how to fix something, telling a teenage boy to toughen up, or telling our young men that they need to stay strong and not cry. All of these received signals and demands over a boy‚Äôs life soon result in the men who become fathers feeling unable to be honest and authentic about how they‚Äôre feeling, what they fear, and what they need from their partners and family. It‚Äôs the same crippling pressure we as women can feel to be demure, attractive, nice, and agreeable. All of these expectations limit our potential not only as individuals but as a society. <br></p> 
   <p>Let us consider the kind of men we want our boys and young men to grow into. The fathers that they will be are the boys that we are molding and teaching today. Imagine a world where fathers felt safe to be vulnerable, emotionally open, and honest about their uncertainties and weaknesses without fear of being shamed for it. Imagine a world where women didn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable or cower at the sight of a man showing vulnerability. Imagine a marriage, where you can go home and know that your vulnerability will be honored as courage and honesty, and that you‚Äôll find support.<br></p> 
   <p>Yes, it will take work, a lot of introspection, and uncomfortable conversations with our loved one, but I can think of no better way to start a new tradition of honesty and authenticity within our family structures.</p> 
   <p>As  said, ‚Äúshow me a woman who can sit with a man in real fear and vulnerability, and I will show you a woman who has done her own work around vulnerability and doesn‚Äôt derive her status or power from that man. You show me a man who can sit with a woman who‚Äôs in real fear and vulnerability, and I‚Äôll show you a man who‚Äôs done his own work around vulnerability and doesn‚Äôt derive his power from being Oz, the all-knowing and all-fixing being.‚Äù</p>

    <p><strong>‚ÄúNo one saves us, but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We ourselves must walk the path.‚Äù </strong><br></p><cite>‚Äì BUDDHA</cite> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p>When considering how we can lead happier lives, this quote from Buddha echoes the conclusions many who have studied happiness have found. In recent years, an increasing number of researchers have set out to uncover what fuels human happiness and joy. The one common finding has been that there is no external material posession, person, or situation that can be our source of happiness. In fact, many have concluded that happiness is a decision we must make for ourselves each and every day.<br></p> 
   <p>In this article, we‚Äôll consider a few ways we can change our perspective and mindset to invite more happiness and joy into our lives. It may not be the overnight, instant reward of eternal happiness you were hoping to get, but it is a long-term solution that each of us is capable of doing for ourselves.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>First let‚Äôs accept that we don‚Äôt need to feel happy all of the time.</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Most of us want to be happy all of the time, but think of anyone you‚Äôve ever known to be happy and joyful all of the time. Even visualizing that is in a way odd and creepy, and that‚Äôs because we as humans are simply not meant to feel happy every moment of the day. Now, while this sounds pretty obvious, when you think about how much we obsess over being and appearing happy, it may be worth considering whether we have actually accepted this fact.<br></p> 
   <p>We research ways to boost our motivation and enthusiasm, post pictures on social media of ourselves laughing and smiling, and judge ourselves when we‚Äôre having days when we feel lethargic or grumpy. Sometimes when we feel sad, frustrated, or even just indifferent, we think ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong with me? why can‚Äôt I just be happy?‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p>The first realization we need to internalize before learning how to invite more happiness into our lives is to be okay with not being happy all of the time. Think about it this way; our lives are like the vast and expansive beautiful sky. What makes those sunny and clear days so beautiful and enjoyable is that we have experienced the discomfort and challenges that come with the bad weather‚Äîthe hurricanes, thunderstorms, and dark clouds. Likewise, human life is made so much more enriching, impressive, and valuable because of the entire range of thoughts and emotions we‚Äôre able to experience.</p>

   <h2><strong>What you focus on becomes your reality.</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>When we accept that we won‚Äôt always feel happy and that the worst of our feelings make our moments of joy even more valuable, we can also start to consider what we focus on throughout the day.<br></p> 
   <p>Now, we do have human nature working against us. Humans are generally hard-wired to dwell on and remember negative situations more than they do positive situations. Likewise, we‚Äôre more readily able to recall painful experiences and emotions than we are joyful and happy moments.<br></p> 
   <p>This is why meditation and mindfulness can be such a powerful habit to adopt. When we practice shifting our attention to all of the positive experiences we have each day, the intensity of our complaints, frustration, and sadness decreases.<br></p> 
   <p>Meditation and mindfulness does not mean that we should dismiss or ignore feelings of sadness, anger, or frustration. It simply means that we can become more aware of those feelings in a wider context. We see the whole picture and with it, all of the things and people that make our lives easier and more joyful.<br></p> 
   <p>Think about all of the things in your life that make every day easier and better. Try to make it a habit to remind yourself of 3 to 5 things to be grateful for every day and see how this habit changes your perspective over time.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>The formula for happiness</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>Happiness Researchers and authors of <em>, </em>Rakesh Sarin and Manel Baucells, explained the formula to happiness as  What they meant by this was that the majority of our misery comes from our expectations not meeting our reality. It can be as little as expecting there to be no traffic and then getting stuck in a jam on the way to work. Or as tragic as expecting someone to continue living a healthy life and then them passing away suddenly.<br></p> 
   <p>For the everyday routines and experiences we have, perhaps the best gift we can give ourselves is to stop expecting what we know will be the situation to be any different. The bus may always be 10 minutes late, people in traffic won‚Äôt always follow the traffic rules, and your cable company‚Äôs customer service probably won‚Äôt be as helpful as you wish it was. There are just some expectations we seem to maintain despite knowing they won‚Äôt be fulfilled. And by doing this we continue to fuel within ourselves frustration, anger, and stress for something we know won‚Äôt change.<br></p> 
   <p>Take a moment to think of a few things you experience frequently that bothers you, but that you know won‚Äôt change. Does this situation deserve to have such a negative impact on your peace of mind?<br></p> 
   <p>Then think of something positive you can focus on when those situations arise.<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Choose happiness everyday. Choose to find meaning in your life.</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>If there‚Äôs one thing we can take away from this conversation, it‚Äôs that we have the absolute power and freedom to choose our emotional and mental state of being. That doesn‚Äôt mean we can simply switch off painful emotions, but we can keep in mind that like all emotions, our pain and sadness will soon transform into other emotions‚Ä¶if we allow it to. And even more than that, we can find value in our pain, knowing that it will make our moments of love and joy that much more special.<br></p> 
   <p>Through gratitude meditations and mindfulness, we can also learn to focus on what makes our lives so incredible and fortunate. Even the most ordinary of things or moments can make our lives substantially better.<br></p> 
   <p>And finally, by focusing on our expectations and our reality, we can determine what we know we can change versus the situations we needlessly fight against every day.<br></p> 
   <p>What are some things you do to invite joy and happiness into your life? Does it feel like sometimes you‚Äôll never feel happy again? What are some practical, realistic expectations you can set to avoid feeling needlessly frustrated?<br></p>

Expectations and Standards in Relationships üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We all hold ourselves and the people around us to certain standards. Just like the ‚ÄúGolden Rule‚Äù of ‚Äútreat others as you‚Äôd like to be treated,‚Äù our standards determine how to act when we‚Äôre by ourselves as well as how we behave towards others. Standards . But sometimes, we confuse standards with expectations. When our often-unvoiced expectations aren‚Äôt met, we feel let down, upset, or even angry. This, in turn, can damage our relationships. So, how can tell our expectations and standards apart and why is it important to understand that difference?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-difference-between-expectations-and-standards""><strong>The Difference Between Expectations and Standards</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Expectations and standards are two very different things. Expectations are the ideas we have about how we want certain situations to turn out or some people to be. Standards, however, are a level of quality that we set for ourselves that serve as a basis for good judgment. Put plainly, expectations are fictions that may or may not be realized. Standards are facts that we live by.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If we expect our partner to always greet us with a bouquet of roses and a smile after work, that is an expectation. It‚Äôs a dream scenario we create in our minds and want to have realized. At the same time, this is also a scenario that might not be realized. Consider this: how likely is it for your partner to always have the energy to pick up flowers for you after work? How likely is it that they‚Äôll always have a great day at work and will be able to greet you with a smile? How likely is it that you‚Äôll forget this and get upset when reality doesn‚Äôt match your expectations? </p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If, however, we expect our partner to be generally affectionate towards us but communicative enough to tell us when he or she has had a bad day at work, that is a standard. In such a case we don‚Äôt expect anything definite. We expect a certain standard of behavior: affection and respectful honesty. Imagine if your partner, who is generally affectionate, were to come home seeming upset, and they didn‚Äôt want to talk about it. How would you react? Would you be offended? Would you take it personally or think that you did something wrong? If this were to happen, then you would naturally feel upset. But if you were to get upset, this wouldn‚Äôt be because your partner didn‚Äôt meet your expectations. It would be because they didn‚Äôt meet the behavioral standards you have, thereby possibly hurting you .</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs important to have standards for yourself. It‚Äôs our standards that determine how others treat us. When we set such standards, we‚Äôre telling others that we respect ourselves, have , and are clear about what we want. By showing people this, we invite them to treat us with the respect that we deserve. Having high expectations of ourselves or others is the opposite of this. At times, we set high expectations because we feel like we don‚Äôt have any control but are trying to feel as though we do. We might also set high standards because we feel insecure in some way and are trying to compensate for that. The scenario mentioned previously, for instance, is a terrific example of this.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-can-i-live-with-this""><strong>‚ÄúCan I Live With This?‚Äù</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Telling the difference between standards and expectations isn‚Äôt always easy. This is especially true in moments when either our standards or expectations aren‚Äôt met. In such moments, we can feel an array of emotions: , hurt, disappointment‚Ä¶ These are all powerful emotions that can cloud our judgment and define our reactions. When we let that happen, we might lash out, yell at our partner, or even start a fight, none of which are constructive to our relationship. Because of this, it‚Äôs important to pull back when we are greeted with such a surge of emotions. Think back: when you‚Äôre faced with an obstacle, how do you best overcome it? Do you rush into the situation headlong, acting out of anger or panic? Or do you tackle the problem calmly and without rushing?</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Odds are, you deal better with a problem when you‚Äôre calm and collected. So, let‚Äôs say your partner did something that either doesn‚Äôt meet your standards or your expectations. Instead of taking this as a call to arms, take a deep breath and pull back. Take deep, calming breaths and focus on the flow of air around you. If you need to, leave the room to give yourself physical space. Settle down and sit comfortably, and just observe your emotions. Is it anger you‚Äôre feeling? Panic? Disappointment? Try to understand why you‚Äôre feeling this way. Is it because your partner left the dishes in the sink, despite your having asked them not to do so many times before? Or is it something deeper? Do you, maybe, feel disrespected as a result of your partner‚Äôs behavior? Or do you feel as though you‚Äôre ignored?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Observing your emotions and reactions and then questioning them can help you to get to the bottom of what fuels these feelings. It might be difficult, but an excellent way of doing this is to ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs this serving me?‚Äù Is this emotion you‚Äôre experiencing or the reaction you‚Äôre giving serving you? In other words, is this emotion or reaction helping me or hurting me? Is it serving my needs as an individual or is it, in fact, a hindrance? Questioning this can help you to let go of what you need to let go of and acknowledge what you don‚Äôt. Once you do, you can decide in a calm, rational environment: Can you live with the behavior that your partner is exhibiting?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-can-i-live-with-it""><strong>Can I Live with It?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Relationships are about compromise. Both sides have to make some adjustments. There are, however, some things that are our deal-breakers. Something or someone not meeting our expectations isn‚Äôt necessarily a deal-breaker. Something or someone not meeting our standards can be.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, let‚Äôs go back to the dirty dishes example. Your partner keeps leaving their dirty dishes in the sink, despite your having asked them not to do so, repeatedly. Instead of blowing up at them, you leave the room for some quiet meditation. You‚Äôve calmed yourself down and gotten to the root of your emotion. You now know, or are starting to know, why you feel the way you do about this situation. Now, ask yourself: can I live with this? Is ‚Äúdirty dishes in the sink‚Äù a deal-breaker for you? Maybe it‚Äôs not. It may be annoying, but you can live with it. Maybe it is a deal-breaker, so the dishes absolutely have to be cleaned. Maybe it‚Äôs not the dishes that are the deal-breaker. It may be that you feel like you‚Äôre not being heard, and <em>that</em> is the real deal-breaker.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Asking yourself the ‚ÄúCan I live with it?‚Äù question is a perfect way of deciding what‚Äôs a standard and what‚Äôs an expectation. If you can live with something, odds are, it wasn‚Äôt a standard ‚Äî just an expectation. If you can‚Äôt live with it, though, then it‚Äôs a standard that needs to be met.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-communication-communication-communication""><strong>Communication, Communication, Communication</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You‚Äôve sat down and meditated on the problem at hand. You‚Äôve come to realize that the problem is because someone‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt meet your standards. Does that mean that you walk away from your relationship right then and there? Not necessarily. That is to say, as long as there isn‚Äôt a serious problem ‚Äì such as domestic violence or abuse ‚Äì then walking away isn‚Äôt necessarily your first option. What you need to do instead is simple: .</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Relationships are generally built on two things: trust and communication. Everyone behaves and thinks according to their own set of standards and beliefs. If something in your relationship doesn‚Äôt meet your standards, then it‚Äôs crucial you discuss it with your partner. When you communicate why something is important to you, it stops being a chore or a note to remember for your partner. It stops being ‚ÄúI have to wash the dishes because my partner doesn‚Äôt like to.‚Äù Instead, it becomes ‚ÄúI have to wash the dishes because not doing so after they asked me to makes them feel like I don‚Äôt listen to them. I don‚Äôt want to make them feel that way.‚Äù</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">An important thing to remember when having this conversation is that there‚Äôs a right way to communicate and a wrong way. The wrong way to have this conversation would be to blame instead of explaining. It would be to just say ‚ÄúX isn‚Äôt working for me‚Äù and leave it at that. This won‚Äôt help us to solve the problem at hand. It might even make things worse because our partner might feel like we‚Äôre attacking them. And that, in turn, may lead to a fight.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The right way to communicate, on the other hand, is steering clear of blame. It‚Äôs explaining a situation in an understandable, polite way, without scolding or berating. It‚Äôs maybe even offering alternatives or middle ground. For instance, it might be saying ‚ÄúThe dirty dishes in the sink really bother me. Can you put them in the dishwasher, if you don‚Äôt want to wash them?‚Äù Once you truly communicate with your partner, you can always ask yourself: can I live with this?<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To face your greatest fear requires that you go beyond expectations to embrace the wild ride of love.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For me my greatest fear was opening up about my difficulties with after experiencing sexual abuse during my childhood. I had great success as a High-Performance Sports Coach, great success as an Inner Peace Coach, and great success in my meditation practice after working one on one with many great teachers for a number of years. Intimate relationships, however, were very difficult for me.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Why were they difficult?<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Because they brought up expectations that were rooted in fear.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Fear-based expectations come from our conditioning, they  and they come from the part of our mind that has to ‚Äúknow‚Äù. It wants a safe outcome, a safe pattern to fit into its stories, and a safe way of living. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We need to have practical expectations around certain things to be able to live in this world. Using the example of intimate relationships, we have expectations in society around what is an appropriate age to be in an intimate relationship and what is appropriate in certain roles. The expectations rooted in fear, however, have no real practical value for us throughout our life but were often triggered in childhood to get our needs met in indirect ways.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-does-meditation-help-with-all-this""><strong>How does meditation help with all this?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I credit my regular meditation practice and wonderful training as the main reason I was able to eventually break through all this negative conditioning with intimate relationships. Although meditation can result in many wonderful inner states and experiences, .<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are two critical things that should be brought into a meditation practice‚Ä¶ </p> 
   <ol class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>A positive intention on something you want to improve in your everyday life </li> 
    <li>An inner posture that has no expectations of how this will look and feel within</li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A positive intention assures we are being grounded and practical. It could be looking for improvements in sleep, , helping with anxiety, improving our relationships, and so on.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Most meditators have this positive intention towards their meditation practice but they limit the results of their meditation hugely because they place many inner expectations on it.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Inner expectations come from our expectations of how our meditation should look and feel within. For the best results with meditation, I suggest an inner posture that accepts and trusts whatever comes up. All of the bodily sensations, , emotions, and moments of deep profound awareness are to be welcomed and embraced during meditation practice.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Otherwise, what happens is that you subtly fit your meditation into a predetermined set of fear-based expectations when really the expectations are what you need to shift to get the practical result you want. For example to relax more you may actually really need to feel a deep emotion very powerfully or some crazy bodily sensations for a couple of minutes. Or maybe what you needed in your meditation was quite a dry and bland experience that didn‚Äôt seem to do a lot. You just don‚Äôt know!</p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p> Fear-based expectations come from our conditioning, they come from our past experiences and they come from the part of our mind that has to ‚Äúknow‚Äù. </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">With a positive intention and open inner posture though you can really trust that something good is happening for you even if it was the complete opposite of what you expected.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This trust comes from the fact that this inner posture opens the door for Divine Love to be the driving force of the meditation practice. This transforms fear-based expectations into an open space of love. Love is the great door-opener, spreading her divine light so  that you so desperately want and need.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The wild ride of love welcomes all into your meditation practice with no need to know, no need to control and the ability to dive deep into whatever is arising in the present moment. Tears may be flowing, then there may be complete silence and then . Love in her infinite waves of surrender and grace welcomes it all in this messy, imperfectly perfect and intensely personal way of meditating.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I suggest taking two firm intentions into your meditation practice before you start, taking a couple of minutes with each.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One intention is about what you are aiming to get out of it in your everyday life and then the other intention is to align with love by allowing all to be there from a place of deep innocence and surrender. Then you relax deeply into the meditation, staying fully present to whatever is arising with perfect trust that this is what needs to be in your awareness right now.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Over time practicing this inner posture helps you see that life is one celebration of love and all that was ever needed was for us to drop the shields of our fear-based expectations that we‚Äôre defending our own little stories and patterns. Love was in our thoughts, love was in our emotions, love was in our bodily sensations and love was in the moments of deep awareness. It was wild, free and totally beyond anything you expected it to be.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-setting-boundaries-first-starts-with-self-awareness""><strong>Setting boundaries first starts with self-awareness.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the first things we need to do in order to set and protect our boundaries is to know what they are in the first place. This requires us to set an intention everyday to become aware of what disturbs us, what makes us , insulted, disrespected, or unconsidered. We all know that feeling when out of nowhere, someone says something or does something that immediately sparks a feeling of annoyance, anger, or frustration in us. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Yet here‚Äôs the thing; sometimes those triggers are on the list of universally accepted offenses and sometimes they‚Äôre not. Lying, stealing, calling someone a crude name, insulting someone‚Äôs physical appearance or intelligence‚Äîthese are behaviors that most people around the world would regard as insulting. In these cases it‚Äôs easy to detect and understand those actions as a transgression of your boundaries.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Yet, in other cases, we can take offense to something that is very personal to us. One of my mentors used to call this a ‚Äòhook‚Äô. She explained that we all have hooks in us that we‚Äôve acquired over our lives based on our life experience. An example of a personal hook may be that you get very anxious when someone raises their voice, all because when you were younger you were constantly screamed at by a parent. So when someone does it as an adult, it immediately brings you back to being reprimanded and feeling oppressed. Or more seriously, if you were physically violated as a child, you may be very sensitive about even the most innocent of touches as an adult. That nice pat on the back or touch on your arm from your boss feels like a trigger for the gruesome ordeal you faced as a child. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take a moment to think about what your personal hooks are. What‚Äôs one thing that sets you off because of a past experience you had in your life?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now think about how you react when someone bumps into that hook. How does it feel? What‚Äôs your usual reaction?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Perhaps the most important part of setting our boundaries is becoming aware of them and this we can do by practicing meditation and  throughout each day of what sets us off. The next time someone annoys or frustrates you, try to consider whether or not they have done so intentionally or whether they‚Äôve run headfirst into one of your hidden hooks. It may be that they‚Äôve done something or said something that to them is not insulting or disrespectful, but to you is uncomfortable.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The next step we can take once we‚Äôve become more aware of our boundaries is to communicate those boundaries .</p>

   <h2 id=""h-communicating-your-boundaries-with-kind-assertiveness""><strong>Communicating your boundaries with kind assertiveness</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Have you ever heard the phrase ‚Äúyou teach people how to treat you‚Äù? It‚Äôs an important step and perhaps the hardest in protecting your personal boundaries. Why? Because most of us are uncomfortable with  or the idea of upsetting someone else. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Yet there is a way to express your boundaries while still preserving goodwill and peace. The problem is that most of us suppress our feelings, and then at some point with the slightest provocation blow up and assert our feelings in a passive aggressive or just full out aggressive way. This, in my opinion, gives assertiveness a bad reputation.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As the same mentor once told me, ‚ÄúSay what you mean, mean what you say, and don‚Äôt be mean about it.‚Äù This was a huge lightbulb moment for me.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By talking with others about what I considered to be violations of my personal boundaries, I could give them almost a roadmap to interacting with me. It‚Äôs like handing out your very own Lonely Planet Book: The ‚ÄòYou‚Äô Edition.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When someone would cross a boundary, I then found it easier to talk about what experiences I had in my life that made whatever they did feel especially sensitive or hurtful to me. At first it was very hard to have these conversations, yet over time I saw how grateful my colleagues and peers were to know these things about me. It also encouraged them to share certain aspects about themselves that I wasn‚Äôt aware of. For example, one colleague I had continued to call ‚Äúcute‚Äù all of the time (because she really was), let me know that from her life experience the word ‚Äúcute‚Äù was somewhat belittling as it was used for small, naive children. I had no idea! And just like that, I stopped calling her that. This, of course, is a simple example but it demonstrates how much we do and say without ever knowing that it bothers others. It also reinforces the notion that most people are actually very well-intentioned but simply do not have enough information about your preferences to not run headfirst into one of your hooks.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-find-support-in-those-who-know-you-best""><strong>Find support in those who know you best</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the best ways you can help yourself on this journey  and setting boundaries is to seek out feedback from those who know you best. Make a list of friends, colleagues, and family members who you trust to talk about your triggers, hooks, and boundaries. These may also be people whose behavior and demeanor in the face of tension or conflict you admire. When certain situations come up and you‚Äôre not sure how to kindly voice your boundaries and feelings, ask them how they would handle it. After some practice, you‚Äôll begin to intuitively know how they would approach certain situations and apply those same habits to your own actions.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôd love to hear more from you on how you set healthy boundaries for yourself; what‚Äôs worked, what hasn‚Äôt? What hooks do you have that you can now communicate to those around you?<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For the last few years, I‚Äôve been devouring articles, books, videos, and seminars led by some of the most influential thought leaders and spiritual guides. The more I followed these inspiring individuals, the more I began to encounter one specific message:<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-act-of-forgiveness-has-the-power-to-heal-you""><strong>The act of forgiveness has the power to heal you.</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Time and time again, this theme repeatedly emerged from these lessons and the way it was presented was as one of the most powerful ways of inviting peace of mind, liberation, . It sounded so seductive and seemingly easy. And yet, as I began to observe myself and my loved ones around me, I realized that while this one act could be the gateway to leading a happier, and more fulfilling life, it was incredibly challenging to pull off.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However you may regard forgiveness, one thing we can all agree on is that it‚Äôs unlikely that any of us will go throughout our whole lives without hurting . If that‚Äôs true, it‚Äôs worth considering how forgiveness can play a role in our overall well-being, peace of mind, and ability to heal.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-is-there-to-forgive""><strong>What is there to forgive?</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">First, let‚Äôs consider what comes before even needing to forgive others. Someone runs headfirst into one of your boundaries and triggers , frustration, shame, or sadness. Think about the last time you felt these emotions; maybe it was something a colleague said to you, perhaps it was a friend who made a remark that hit you the wrong way or a family member whose actions have caused you pain. Whatever it is, the situation left you feeling disturbed, angry, sad, or betrayed.<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Oftentimes, we in society have some certain universal understandings of what could be considered offensive, insulting, or hurtful. Behaviors like infidelity, physical or emotional abuse, dishonesty, or violence are accepted by most as a violation of respect and human integrity. Yet very quickly the boundaries and rules for what is considered offensive become a matter of personal perspective. In other words, what might easily offend me may be brushed off by another person. And what easily angers or frustrates another may be seen as harmless to me.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Throughout my research around the topic of forgiveness, I have continued to encounter the notion that identifying our own personal internal boundaries is not only essential to forgiveness, but can help us acknowledge past experiences that contributed to the formation of those boundaries. In other words, the moments when we feel offended or disrespected can serve as opportunities to pause and learn. In this way, rather than react to those instances with judgement, blame, or shame, we can embrace the notion that the discomfort we feel when someone crosses our personal boundaries is actually an opportunity to learn something about ourselves. When these situations arise, there are some questions we can ask ourselves when we feel personally wronged:<br></p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Why did this happen?</li> 
    <li>How did I allow for someone to treat me this way?</li> 
    <li>How have I continued to make it acceptable for someone to treat me this way?</li> 
    <li>What is this person mirroring back to me?</li> 
    <li>How can this experience serve me?</li>

   <h2 id=""h-turning-pain-and-discomfort-into-self-awareness-and-growth""><strong>Turning Pain and Discomfort into Self-Awareness and Growth</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These instances can also be an opportunity for the person who offended youand evolve. It‚Äôs most likely that either this person has done something they didn‚Äôt realize would hurt you or acted from a place of their own pain and sadness. Just as the old adage states, ‚Äúhurt people hurt people.‚Äù Taking this into consideration, this mutual learning fits into the idea that we all have <em>soul contracts</em> with each person we meet and interact with. Part of this soul contract is that each of us is in each other‚Äôs lives to teach the other person something they need to learn or heal in order to ascend towards enlightenment. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">To give a practical example, think about a problem or issue you have repeatedly experienced with people throughout your life. It may be that you always seem to befriend people who put you down, or perhaps you find that there have been many instances where you‚Äôve struggled to apologize for your mistakes, even when you knew you were wrong. Each of us have certain patterns of behavior that we attract and allow into our lives because we haven‚Äôt learned how to overcome or evolve past that behavior. Therefore, until we learn whatever lessons those experiences offer, we will continue to encounter them over and over again.<br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take a moment to think about any repeated emotional challenges you have faced over the last few years with different people, in different situations. Let‚Äôs then pause to consider that if it‚Äôs those repeated instances of sadness, frustration, and shame that make up the majority of negative feelings in our lives, wouldn‚Äôt it be worth trying to learn from those experiences and evolve past them? I know for me personally if I realized that I could begin to slowly eliminate the biggest sources of grief and misery in my life, I would be more inclined to lean into the discomfort of tackling those lessons head on.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-don-t-forgive-just-to-forgive-forgive-to-heal""><strong>Don‚Äôt forgive just to forgive, forgive to heal.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs a hitch though. Once we get into the habit of pausing and learning from the instances that cause us distress, we can‚Äôt just jump right to forgiveness. The journey of forgiveness can be incredibly painful and uncomfortable, so oftentimes rather than have the uncomfortable conversation, we instead simply jump to the part where one person says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù and the other person replies ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, I forgive you.‚Äù Yeah‚Äîwe‚Äôve all tried out that card. The problem with that tactic is that it simply doesn‚Äôt heal or resolve anything.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This habit is reinforced by many cultural and religious traditions that encourage and even mandate forgiveness as a means of measuring our ‚Äúgoodness‚Äù. It also feeds into the idea that we can get instant gratification and reward for an action we take. Yet, just like most transformations, there‚Äôs no quick ‚Äòforgiveness pill‚Äô that will work overnight. Forgiveness when forced or feigned is not only meaningless, but can be even more harmful to a relationship. Now not only do you have the negative emotions from the initial situation, you have a layer of dishonesty and inauthenticity to top it off.<br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Nevertheless, many of us have tried this tactic only to find that we still feel a knot in our chests; we still cannot stop thinking about the situation, and continue to relive it over and over again. Over time, the violation or betrayal only grows bigger and more toxic in our minds as we continue to suppress and avoid it. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is a form of emotional self-abuse that not only detracts from the joy of the present moment, but oftentimes is projected onto those around you. And when we project our pain and hurt onto others, we are essentially doing the same thing as those who have hurt us in the past, acting out of their own place of pain. This cycle of projecting our pain onto others can only be stopped when we muster the courage to be vulnerable and choose to cultivate within ourselves empathy and compassion rather than contempt and shame. <br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-empathy-and-compassion-as-tools-for-forgiveness""><strong>Empathy and Compassion as tools for forgiveness</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So let‚Äôs be clear. You cannot experience the full healing power of forgiveness without  and feelings you are experiencing. And the two emotional tools we must nurture in order to work through those feelings with an intention to heal are compassion and empathy‚Äîwith others and ourselves. When we acknowledge that all humans, including ourselves, are fallible and that we are all influenced and guided by our own life experiences, we‚Äôre able to see ourselves and others with more compassion. <br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image"">

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Just as we have made mistakes, hurt others, or made the wrong decisions based on our emotional maturity and life experience at the time, others have also made mistakes based on what they knew at the time. Oftentimes, really internalizing this fact requires us to set our ego aside and think from another person‚Äôs perspective. It‚Äôs normal that this won‚Äôt happen immediately. Yet and a kind patience, over time we can understand that another‚Äôs actions had less to do with hurting us and more to do with reflecting their own emotional immaturity. &nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That being said, compassion and boundaries are not mutually exclusive. You can still have compassion for the pain and life experiences that led to someone hurting you, while still choosing not to have them in your life or allowing them to repeat that behavior with you. who has hurt you also does not exonerate them or mean that they are not held accountable. Yet withholding empathy and forgiveness as a means of punishing another person for how they have wronged you will only sow seeds of contempt and toxicity within your own energy. This toxicity, as we mentioned before, will then come out in how you act and behave towards others.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-forgiveness-as-a-liberating-form-of-self-love""><strong>Forgiveness as a liberating form of self-love</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Like anything worth learning and achieving, forgiveness takes a grueling amount of self-awareness, mindfulness, . There‚Äôs no promise that it‚Äôs easy to do, yet there is the guarantee that when done it will provide you with the greatest sense of peace, love, and acceptance.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As we discussed in this article, the moments that warrant forgiveness from us can be seen as opportunities to learn more about our boundaries and triggers. These uncomfortable moments set the stage for us to evolve past the needs and wants of our egos and transcend beyond limiting. Because when you love and respect yourself fully, you will always have the courage to kindly assert your boundaries with compassion.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Forgiveness can prevent us from acting out against others from a place of . All of the negative energy you harbor within yourself will be released, rather than projected onto those around you.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Finally, forgiveness can help you cast off the shackles of a story you have continued to define yourself by. In most cases, these are that you continue to allow to drive your decisions and behaviors in the present moment. All the while, we don‚Äôt acknowledge that when we allow those stories to be present in who we are today, we are giving them power. Forgiveness allows you to essentially download the lesson any experience presents you, release the emotions and feelings that do not serve you and continue forward in your life.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Yet, the first step we must take on the path to forgiveness is to love ourselves enough to release ourselves from this burden.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And now, I‚Äôd like to hear from you in the comment section below. What have been your biggest struggles with forgiving others who have hurt you or with forgiving yourself for past wrongdoings? What do you tell yourself about the idea of forgiving? <br></p>

How to Practice Self-Love Even on Your Busiest Days üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Imagine a hectic day, when you‚Äôre busy running around from the moment you open your eyes until the moment you go to bed. It shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to imagine. Sometimes it seems like every day is a repeat of the day before and we‚Äôre constantly trying to get something or other done. The life that we‚Äôre leading is our own, yet how much do we really take care of ourselves in our daily lives? As it turns out, the verdict on that is still pending. Sure, we eat, sleep, and take care of our most basic necessities. But what about our emotional needs, our psychological needs? When we look in the mirror in the morning we say ‚ÄúOf course, I love myself,‚Äù but sometimes we don‚Äôt really actualize that love. Is it that 24 hours isn‚Äôt enough to squeeze in self-love??<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-an-intention-to-practice-self-love""><strong>An Intention to Practice Self-Love</strong></h2> 
   <p>I love myself, but do I really show that to myself? The first step is asking this question and answering it honestly. Love takes effort, and we need to make that effort to feel just how valuable we are. ‚ÄúHuman beings love that which they make an effort for and they make an effort for the things they love,‚Äù says the esteemed author, Erich Fromm. That‚Äôs why if you love and value yourself, you have to make room for yourself in your daily life and make an effort to take care of yourself. The more you make room for yourself, the more you‚Äôll start taking care of yourself. Most of the time, we seek the love and attention we need from others. But the love and attention that we crave is already within us. You know how you complain about not having enough time? Don‚Äôt believe the inner voice that says that. Everyone has at least a little bit of time they can spare for themselves. The first step &nbsp;is to believe this and take action. Love, after all, knows no boundaries. <br></p> 
   <p>This might seem daunting at first. So, take a breath. You have plenty of time to spend on self-love practices. Why not start by planning out your day? Not planning your day can often make you run around in a panic, trying to complete one task after the next. But if you plan out your day right, you can start making room for the self-love practices you need in your schedule. Once you start these practices, you‚Äôll quickly experience the joy they bring to your life. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-a-list-to-make-space-for-yourself""><strong>A list to make space for yourself</strong></h2> 
   <p>Our days are often packed with different routines. Some of us experience this as parents, some as students and some as part of the workforce. All these different roles come with a multitude of changing responsibilities. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make some time in your schedule for some self-love and self-care practices. Here are a few practices that might help:<br></p> 
   <p>Revolutionize your day by setting a new alarm for yourself in the mornings. Wake up 30 minutes earlier than you normally do. 30 minutes out of 24 hours is really nothing when you think about it. You can do it!<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-look-over-your-routine-and-determine-what-you-can-take-care-of-early-on""><strong>Look over your routine and determine what you can take care of early on.</strong></h2> 
   <p><strong> Here are a few examples:</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Check how the weather will be tomorrow and decide what you‚Äôll wear in advance. A lot of us spend a good deal of time standing in front of our closets, and there are times when we choose outfits that we‚Äôre not too happy with because we‚Äôve run out of time. By choosing our outfits in advance, we can free up 10 minutes the following morning and spend it by doing something we like, such as putting on makeup or shaving. </li> 
    <li>Pack your bag the night before. Odds are, you‚Äôre not using the same bag every day and even if you do what you put in it often changes. This way you can skip the mad dash through the house trying to find everything you need, and replace it with an exercise you enjoy, such as morning stretches or yoga. </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Plan what you‚Äôre going to do after you wake up:</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Choose a piece of music or melody that you like as your alarm. That way you can start your day with intention and a smile on your face. </li> 
    <li>Wash your face with plenty of water. Let the water freshen you up.</li> 
    <li>Look at yourself in the mirror and really see yourself. Repeat these magic words: ‚ÄúGood morning. Today is a new day. How are you feeling? You are really beautiful and I love you.‚Äù Say all of this or part of it. Say whatever else comes to your mind. Choose what you want to say to yourself but be aware of what you‚Äôre saying as you‚Äôre saying it. You‚Äôll quickly begin to notice their effects.</li> 
    <li>You‚Äôve prepared your bag in advance. Now, you can use your take your time getting ready, instead of rushing.</li> 
    <li>You‚Äôd set your alarm 30 minutes earlier than usual. Now you can use your extra time to do some breathing exercises or to meditate. Don‚Äôt deny yourself this sincere moment with yourself. Meditate for 30 minutes, five minutes, or just one. But take the time to check in with yourself. <br><br></li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Pause throughout the day:</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Don‚Äôt be fooled by things that feel impossible. Always aim to try.</li> 
    <li>Set alarms to remind yourself to take a break throughout the day. I know today is a very busy day. But you can continue researching possible kindergartens tomorrow. Do you really have to hand in that report you‚Äôre working on in the next few minutes, or can you afford to pause for a moment? </li> 
    <li>Set alarms to ‚Äúcheck in with yourself.‚Äù You can delay these alarms if you‚Äôre too busy at that moment, but don‚Äôt turn them off. Here are few things you can do during these times, when you‚Äôre able: Rest your hands on your lap and ask yourself how your day is going. Hug yourself. Refresh your makeup in the mirror or splash some water on your wrists. Smile at yourself and ask yourself if you need anything.</li> 
   </ul> 
   <p><strong>Get ready for bed:</strong></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Get ready for bed the same way you got ready for the day this morning.</li> 
    <li>Keeping a diary can be an excellent self-care routine. Sit down and write what you felt and experienced throughout the day. Document small moments that are important to you.</li> 
    <li>Prepare for the next day in advance and go to bed. </li> 
   </ul>

   <h2 id=""h-extra-suggestions""><strong>Extra Suggestions</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>You can add weekly or even monthly routines to your ‚ÄúCheck-Up Moments.‚Äù Here are a couple of things you can do:<br></p> 
   <ul> 
    <li>Make an appointment with yourself every month. Determine when and where this appointment will be and how long it‚Äôll last. Make sure you do this, even if it‚Äôs only for 10 minutes, even if you can‚Äôt go anywhere. Buy yourself a drink and ask yourself how things are going, just as you would with a friend. &nbsp;</li> 
    <li>Buy yourself a gift every day: Don‚Äôt think of this as an extravagance. Turn something you need into a gift. Occasionally buy yourself something that you don‚Äôt need and spoil yourself. Have something you ordered online gift wrapped and write yourself a little note. <br></li> 
   </ul> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-busy-are-you-really""><strong>How busy are you really?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Much of the time we could potentially spend on our own well-being and health, we end up spending on other things. At the end of the day, we often complain about how tired we are. So, re-examine your day and how busy you really are.</p> 
   <p>How much of it is manufactured and how much of it is real? There are times when we‚Äôre truly busy. But these times can‚Äôt become so common that they become routine. So, try some of the suggestions above, instead of filling up your free time with more things to do. You‚Äôll be amazed at how good this will make you feel. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-preventing-your-anxiety-from-affecting-your-children""><strong>Preventing Your Anxiety From Affecting Your Children</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs an old saying: ‚ÄúAnxious mothers make for anxious children.‚Äù Substitute ‚Äúmothers‚Äù for ‚Äúparents‚Äù and you‚Äôll find that the saying still holds true. In fact, if we look at statistics on mental health from around the world, we‚Äôll find that this saying rings true now more than ever. In 2017, the National Institute of Mental Health announced that 38% of teenage girls and 26% of teenage boys are dealing with anxiety disorders. Today 1 in 4 to the point of working themselves up into panic attacks and emotional distress. But why is that? Why are anxiety rates so high among our children and what can we do to change it?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-transmitting-anxiety""><strong>Transmitting Anxiety</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A lot of people believe that anxiety is an inheritable . They‚Äôre partly right. Anxiety can run in the family, but not because it‚Äôs a genetically inherited condition, though some people are more prone to anxiety than others. It‚Äôs because anxiety is a learned behavior, that parents or guardians pass onto their children, without really meaning to.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Psychologists agree that the best predictor of a child‚Äôs stress or anxiety level is the stress or anxiety level of the key adults in their life. In other words, if a child senses that their parents or guardians are&nbsp; ‚Äì and they will sense even if we try to hide it ‚Äì and as a result will grow increasingly stressed and anxious as well.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-we-transmit-our-anxiety-to-our-children""><strong>How We Transmit Our Anxiety to Our Children</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You might wonder how children are able to detect these emotions, even when you do your best to mask them. Though not all indicators are through emotions; in many cases, we demonstrate  in how we interact with others. A classic way of transmitting our anxiety to children is by being overinvolved. When we‚Äôre anxious, we try to take control of what‚Äôs going on around us to alleviate some of what we‚Äôre feeling. Let‚Äôs say that we‚Äôre up for review or a promotion at the office. In these situations we can‚Äôt do anything to control the review and what happens afterward. All we can do is wait.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, we take control of what we can. Say our child is playing in the sandbox with another kid and they get into a small argument. Instead of letting him manage the situation on his own, we immediately step in to ‚Äúdefend‚Äù our kid. Before we know it, the other kid‚Äôs mother is there as well and the whole thing‚Äôs escalated beyond what it should have. What‚Äôs more, we‚Äôve taken all control from our kid‚Äôs hands and denied them the chance to develop conflict resolution skills and build a friendship. By stepping in, we‚Äôve also basically told our kids ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt handle this on your own‚Äù. This is a message we‚Äôre bound to repeat every time we interfere. It‚Äôs a small wonder then that by interfering we not only generate a lack of self-confidence in our kids but feelings of inadequacy as well.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">No parent ever wants to hurt their kids, unintentionally or otherwise. It‚Äôs normal for us as parents to sometimes let our anxiety or stress get the best of us and it‚Äôs not realistic to think that our kids will never see us stressed. Though there are ways we can prevent our anxiety from affecting our kids, as well as our relationship with them, while learning to manage our anxiety. Here we‚Äôll list 5 coping skills to consider and begin becoming more aware of in your day to day life and in the presence of our children.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-have-a-support-system-and-know-when-to-talk-to-them""><strong>Have a support system and know when to talk to them.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As a rule of thumb, the saying ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre just kids, they won‚Äôt understand us,‚Äù is not usually true. Children can easily understand what is going on around them, as well as our worries and anxieties. So, it‚Äôs important to try to be open and clear about your feelings and hard times you are passing through. We should have a secure and safe communication space with them to talk about sensitive topics. Asking support from a psychologist or a pedagog is definitely a good option.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-explain-and-introduce-healthy-triggers""><strong>Explain and introduce healthy triggers.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs say that you were bitten by a dog years ago. Because of this, you‚Äôre very afraid of dogs, so much so that you cross the street, whenever you see a dog coming towards you. An important thing to do in these situations is to explain to your kids why you react the way that you do. When you explain the reason behind your fear and that ‚Äúnot all dogs are bad‚Äù, your kids won‚Äôt automatically reason that ‚Äúall dogs are dangerous‚Äù. Telling your child about your unpleasant experience will help them to establish their own right and wrong.&nbsp;</p>

   <h3 id=""h-understand-your-triggers""><strong>Understand your triggers.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Speaking of triggers, if you want to learn to manage your anxiety, it‚Äôs important for you to understand the sources of these emotions. Take a moment the next time you‚Äôre hit with a bout of anxiety. Meditate on what you were doing or feeling right before. Take notes and try to explore the moments leading up to it. What exactly do you feel? What were you doing right before you began to feel this way? Only by identifying your triggers and their accompanying patterns can you move towards changing how you respond to them.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-encourage-healthy-risks""><strong>Encourage healthy risks.</strong> </h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre at the playground and are afraid of heights. Your kid really likes climbing the monkey bars but the thought of it makes you very anxious. So much so, that you either want to stop him or give him a limit as to how high he can climb. When you begin to feel this way, take a deep breath and give yourself a moment. Remind yourself that children learn by doing and stopping him now will hurt more than it‚Äôll help. If you have difficulty with this, make a point of going to the park with a fellow parent. Remember, you are not alone in this. Talking to a friend, who is also a parent, will help you to relax.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A child first learns of the world through observing their parents. So, what better way to teach them and help yourself than working to adopt healthy coping mechanisms. By adopting coping mechanisms when you‚Äôre feeling anxious, you won‚Äôt be transmitting your anxiety to your kids. Instead, you‚Äôll be teaching them how to cope with anxiety when they experience it. If you want, you can take this a step further and actively teach these strategies to your kids. This will not only give them valuable tools for the future but serve as a great bonding time for the both of you. Learn and do meditative breathing exercises together: Breathe in for four seconds, breathe out for four seconds. Or inhale slowly, count your breaths and try to get to ten. Try mindfulness apps and meditation whenever you feel anxious. Take daily, 30-minute walks together with your kid. Keep a journal and encourage your kid to do the same.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Finally, and this may be the most important part‚Äîplease be kind and patient with yourself. As parents, no one gave us a guidebook to help us navigate every situation. Having children under your care is a daunting and overwhelming journey, and it‚Äôs unrealistic to imagine that we‚Äôll always do everything perfectly. Yet remember that it‚Äôs not so much about trying to avoid making mistakes, as much as it‚Äôs about modeling to your children how to rectify wrongdoings. You‚Äôre doing the best you can with the skills and emotional tools you have and so are all other parents. It‚Äôs a poor use of our time to judge ourselves or other parents for their wrong-doings; nothing positive will come of shame. Yet by continuing to have conversations with our community of parents and guardians, we can support one another in learning better ways of  with our children.<br></p>

Why Does Meditation Increase My Focus? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We all know that  has a myriad of benefits. It strengthens our immune system, helps us to manage stress and be more intune with our emotions‚Ä¶ Meditation also helps us with something that‚Äôs becoming increasingly difficult these days: It increases our ability to focus. With the advent of technology, we now have increasingly shorter attention spans. We no longer want to read long books. We have an ocean of Tweets to read instead. We don‚Äôt want to watch long documentaries. Instead, we can pass the time looking at 1-minute cat videos. What‚Äôs more, we‚Äôre under a constant attack of stimuli by technology. We sit down to work and our phones keep pinging with messages. We try to write a report but receive email after email. Under these circumstances, it‚Äôs no wonder that the average human attention span has shrunk nearly a quarter in the past 15 years! This is why meditation‚Äôs ability to increase our focus is so important for our daily, academic and professional lives.</p>

   <p>Five years ago, researcher Sara Lazar set out to prove that the effects of meditation were bogus. She conducted a study that was supposed to show that meditation didn‚Äôt affect the human brain at all and that whatever effects we felt after meditating were a placebo effect. However, she ended up proving the exact opposite: that meditation physically changed the human brain. The news quickly made its way into all news outlets. We suddenly had tangible proof that meditation can do an array of things, such as increase a person‚Äôs focus. But how and why is meditation able to do this? Why does meditating help us to concentrate?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-thickening-brain""><strong>The Thickening Brain</strong></h2> 
   <p>Sara Lazar‚Äôs study was simple: She recruited a group of participants, gave them an 8-week long program and regularly took brain scans of each individual to see if there was any visible change in their brains. To her surprise, there was. After following the 8 week program, various areas in the test participants‚Äô brains had visibly thickened. One such area was the posterior cingulate, which is associated with self-reliance and how often our mind wanders. Another was the left hippocampus which is associated with memory, cognition, learning, and emotions.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Following the publication of Lazar‚Äôs work another researcher, Adam Moore decided to conduct his own study to see to what degree meditation affected our concentration. Moore‚Äôs study revolved around 40 participants who meditated 5 days a week, only ten minutes a day. After 16-weeks Moore realized that the participants levels of concentration had increased significantly compared to before.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-so-we-know-the-how-but-why-does-meditation-increase-our-focus""><strong>So, we know the how. But why does meditation increase our focus?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Imagine you‚Äôre at the gym for the first time in a long while, lifting weights. You start small but go every day, doing the same movements, increasing the weight you‚Äôre working with bit by bit. A couple of weeks go by and as you‚Äôre walking by a mirror you suddenly realize that your arms look much bigger than they used to. You can clearly see that you have toned up your muscles and it‚Äôs only now when you realize that all the time in the gym has paid off.</p> 
   <p>Meditation works the same way. Sitting down and watching your breath might sound like a simple task. Though it‚Äôs actually pretty challenging because it means that you will try to be aware of your own thoughts, and your immediate response towards them. It means that you will , to your sensations, or to whatever keeps you in that moment when you realize that your thoughts were wandered off. Mindfulness helps you be fully present in the moment without forcing anything, with no, or at least minimum effort. This is why you gradually begin improving our focus as you practice meditation. In time, you become more and more mindful throughout our daily life, no matter what activity we‚Äôre engaged in.&nbsp; So put plainly, meditation means engaging and training the parts of your brain that are in charge of your focus and concentration, like your posterior cingulate and left hippocampus. That being the case, it‚Äôs no wonder that these areas of the brain grow bigger after you meditate for a short while, now is it?</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-as-a-means-to-increase-our-focus""><strong>Meditation as a means to increase our focus</strong></h2> 
   <p>Considering the facts at hand, it‚Äôs clear that mindfulness meditation is one of the best ways to increase your focus and concentration. However, there are some mindfulness tricks that you can try throughout the day to help you out, particularly if you‚Äôre new to meditation and are having a hard time with it.</p> 
   <p>When you sit down for a guided meditation, one of the directives you‚Äôll receive most often will be to turn your attention to how your breath feels going in or out or to focus on a particular part of your body. When you do this, you hone in on certain senses in our bodies. But you don‚Äôt necessarily need to be meditating to do so. As such, one of the things you can do to improve your focus is to create a sensation in your body and focus on it. Take a look at your hands. Squeeze them as tightly as you can for a few moments then let go. Now close your eyes and focus on how your hands feel? What does this sensation feel like? How long does it take to go away? How do your hands feel after the feeling has gone away?</p>

   <p>Though ‚Äútouch‚Äù is a good sense to focus on, it‚Äôs not the only thing you can rely on to help improve your focus. Another is sight and therefore, observation. Pick up a familiar object and place it in front of you. Now stare at it as long as you‚Äôre able to and try to take in every single detail that you can. Keep check of when your mind begins to wander and make a point of bringing your attention back to the object in question. What do you see? The more you do this, the more you‚Äôll improve your focus and, for that matter, your mindfulness.</p> 
   <p>A last practice you can try involves music and another one of your senses; your hearing. Put on your favorite musical piece and listen to it carefully. Don‚Äôt just pay attention to the lyrics (if there are any) but try to notice the beat, the rhythm and the background instruments‚Ä¶ What instruments can you hear, and which ones dominate the others? How does this particular piece make you feel? Does it evoke any memories or imagery? Don‚Äôt be afraid to explore and observe these things that the music gives rise. Just remember to not be swept up by them so much that you forget to hear the music.</p> 
   <p>These are just a few mindfulness tricks that you can use to help you increase your focus. But as always, we‚Äôd love to hear from you! Do you have any trouble focusing or concentrating? Have you ever tried such exercises? If you have, what exercises or activities have helped you to increase your focus. Share your experience with us!</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Bear with me, this experience I‚Äôm about to dive into may seem like a stretch for some, yet recently I uncovered the best gift I could have ever imagined giving myself. It was unique, transformative, and humbling; the only way I can describe it is as drinking from the water of life. This experience rejuvenated and reinvigorated me in such a way that I felt such  and joy afterwards.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This experience emerged within me once I completed the ‚ÄúStress Management‚Äù program. As the  drew to an end, it was as if a gentle voice whispered in my ear, telling me to thank myself and I actually found myself saying, ‚ÄúI just drank from the water of life.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Perhaps it was my literary side peeking out, but the ‚Äúwater of life‚Äù expression came to me all on its own.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I encountered this deep well in me in the morning. It‚Äôs given me such a flexibility that I was surprised to find myself in bed during my last meditation. When I first started meditating, I‚Äôd set myself certain rules: I would always be sitting down, with my legs crossed. Though by the end of the 8th week, I understood that being ‚Äúrelaxed‚Äù could mean very different things for very different people. Once I made it halfway through the program, I began meditating with my back leaning against a wall, with my feet stretched out before me because I‚Äôd hurt my knee. Of course, there is a big difference between the two: one was a compromise I made out of necessity and the other was an effort to be kind with myself and choose compassion for the discomfort I was feeling in my knee area. This last practice, I was equally kind and  and thought to myself, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold today, I can meditate from under the warm covers‚Äù. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-unable-to-breathe""><strong>Unable to breathe</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">My breath lead me to this well of life water within me. While I used to before starting this 8-week meditation program, I could never really be in the moment with my breathing. In the past, whenever I would be guided to focus on my breath, I would start to feel claustrophobic. My heartbeat would pick up and in some instances, I would end up. It sounds strange that by just focusing on my breathing I would get so anxious, and yet it continued to happen. What proved to be my anchor during these times was focusing on the palms of my hands. By focusing on this small area, I would feel present and alive, as if I could feel my pulse right in the palm of my hand. Looking back, I now see this was because I had right there cupped in my hands, the water of life.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Over time, . Yet even though I did feel an improvement, still every time I focused on my inhalations and exhalations, I would feel a space open up in my chest joined by a sinking feeling in my stomach. Then my heart palpitations would increase suddenly and that feeling of claustrophobia would start to creep in. I started to feel a bit hopeless, as if there was no way to overcome this.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What happened to me was the result of being able to try something without judging myself. Yet it was only possible after continuous work and efforts. I was able to find that when I would stop relying solely on my palms, I was stillwith life through my breath.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">However difficult and emotionally challenging these practices were, I can say with absolute certainty that this has been the biggest gift I‚Äôve been able to give myself. Reconnecting with my existence made me feel like I was finally rooted in place, steady in my own skin, and able to nourish myself with the water of life. Now in the future, should I ever feel this panic and anxiety, I feel I have the tools within me to tap back into this . Of course, there will be times when I evolve, transform, and shed my leaves. Times when I wilt and bloom again, yet at no point will my essence be compromised.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-allows-me-to-sustain-myself""><strong>Meditation allows me to sustain myself.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That‚Äôs one of the most valuable components I‚Äôve found about meditation. Meditation teaches us skills and techniques to be able to conjure up all of these emotions, feelings, , and revelations all by ourselves. In this way, I, myself, am able to use what I already have within me to nourish myself with this water of life. I don‚Äôt need to rely on others or outside influences to sustain me; meditation allows me to sustain myself.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs amazing the things I‚Äôve accomplished in such a short time! Throughout these 8 weeks I was given, I persevered, refused to be fooled by the games my mind played, invited myself to reflect, and was kind and compassionate to myself. There were mornings when I wanted to pull the covers over my head and just put all of my sources of anxiety to the side. But come the next morning, I picked up where I left off. Through this perseverance I was able to open up new channels in my mind, and internalize new and positive memories and thought patterns in my brain. Again, it was on my own, out of my own will, that I was able to feed myself with this rooting water of life.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That‚Äôs not to say that the world and my life is perfect now. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm able to observe and interact with others with more clarity. &nbsp;Sure, I still have to wear glasses but my vision has gotten better. The more I continue the practice, the better my vision will become. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I feel so humbled and proud to have not only overcome this 8-week course, but to have uncovered this rich source of life within myself. The gratitude I feel is like fuel that will propel me forward. Granted, there‚Äôll still be mornings when I pull the covers over my head, simply because my body or soul aches too much, but one thing‚Äôs for sure: It‚Äôs possible to stay in bed and meditate too. <br></p>

The Secret to Success: Being Present üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We don‚Äôt spend a lot of our time being present in the moment. When we are not engaged in intense action or thinking, or when we are not concentrating our minds, then we actually become present. </p> 
   <p>If we take a step back and look at our lives from afar, our time is divided into three modes of living: by taking actions, by thinking, and by being in the moment. Of those three means of living, we primarily operate in ‚Äòaction mode‚Äô. Whether it‚Äôs when we‚Äôre at work, partaking in a hobby, or having a conversation, the majority of our days is about taking action. The next most common mode we spend our time in is in our ‚Äòthinking mode‚Äô. Thinking is an activity that we do when we‚Äôre not in action mode, or when we‚Äôre partaking in an activity that doesn‚Äôt require a lot of focus or concentration. Think of when you‚Äôre lying in bed before you fall asleep, on your commute to work, or waiting in line at the bank. After memorizing the route home, it can even happen while you‚Äôre driving home from work.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-then-when-exactly-can-we-be-present-and-what-does-that-have-to-do-with-success""><strong>Then when exactly can we be present? And what does that have to do with success? </strong></h2> 
   <p>The third, shortest portion of our lives is spent on being present. The best opportunities to be present are when we‚Äôre not partaking in an action that requires focus, talking with others, or thinking about a certain issue or topic. Think about it; how much of your day could then be used for practicing being present? For most of us, it‚Äôs not a lot. Yet when we do get those short blocks of time to just exist, we‚Äôre able to pay attention with more awareness to our sensations, surroundings, feelings, and emotions. This could be while going for a walk, while listening to music, or meditating.</p> 
   <p>This is easier said than done though, especially when you live in a culture and society that puts so much emphasis on progressing forward, taking action, and being productive. Our families, friends, and even politicians always highlight the need to think, plan, and take action, yet they rarely mention the importance of being present. Within this framework of thinking, being present and taking that time for yourself to just sit and be aware of yourself and surroundings can be considered lazy, unproductive, and useless. Yet, these perspectives are missing a significant point that in order to be successful, we must allow ourselves to tap into our own well of creativity, self-awareness, values, and drive.</p> 
   <p>In fact, being present both psychologically and spiritually is one of the most powerful states of mind we can be in. When we live in the present moment and immerse ourselves fully into the experience we‚Äôre currently participating in, we in a sense give our minds the space to rest, recover, explore, and consider different perspectives. These moments of being present are the moments when composers, writers, administrators, artists, and scientists come up with new ideas, make connections, and form insights.</p> 
   <p>When we look at the important discoveries or breakthroughs throughout history, we see that the one common denominator is having a consistent practice of being present. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p>For example, even though we know this story didn‚Äôt happen exactly like this, we know that Newton first thought about the laws of gravity when he observed an apple fall from a tree he was sitting under. Descartes thought of the coordinate system used in geometry as he was trying to fall asleep, Niels Bohr was half-asleep when he dreamed of electrons moving around an atom, Paul McCartney would hear melodies as he was waking up, Sigmund Freud would always go for a walk to let his thoughts flow.</p> 
   <p>That being said, this is not to take away from the importance of also spending our time involved in the other two states of being, that is in action and thinking. The point is that there needs to be a more balanced division of how we spend our time. Just as being present was important to the aforementioned innovations, so was the actions and thinking processes involved in formulating those ideas. There are hours, days, months, and maybe even years of action, thought, and mindfulness that are behind every ‚Äúa-ha!‚Äù moment.</p> 
   <p>All of these considerations can perhaps convince us as a society and culture to redefine how to perceive giving ourselves time to be present and just sit with our thoughts, emotions, and surroundings. Once we acknowledge how fundamental this time and space is for us to cultivate creativity, innovation, and new perspectives, we may be more willing to allow for this time. Taking the point one step further, we may even find that the way we define and perceive a good use of time changes as we begin to embrace simply being present. It is somewhat jolting when you realize that you spend hardly any time for weeks and even months on end just allowing yourself to sit and be completely present in the moment. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-role-of-meditation""><strong>The role of meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p>This is where meditation can play a very crucial role in easing you into a consistent habit of allowing for this time to be present. Meditation teaches us how to control our minds, including how to give it the space to roam and be present. By taking 10 minutes a day to meditate, closing our eyes, and focusing on the exact moment that we‚Äôre in, we‚Äôll create the foundation for ourselves to tap into our greatest source of creativity and potential. Just like every new habit, it may seem difficult at first, but by practicing how to control our minds, we may enjoy the most rewarding benefits yet.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, you‚Äôve finished your first meditation. How did you feel afterwards? Most of us experience things like a sense of calm, relaxation, or a surge of compassion. The funny thing is, meditation doesn‚Äôt bring these emotions and sensations to us from the outside in. It does so by making us aware of emotions and sentiments buried deep within ourselves; ones we might have even forgotten. That is to say, our minds are so busy throughout the day that sometimes we forget to feel these emotions. We‚Äôre rushing about from the moment we wake up and our minds are so overcrowded that to our emotions. But meditation enables us to experience them again, even if it‚Äôs only a little bit at first. If we want to experience more, we have dig deep, and explore our own depths.<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, it‚Äôs possible that you didn‚Äôt  very clearly yet. You may therefore have certain questions and be experiencing some confusion. Just know that, that‚Äôs perfectly normal. This is your first time trying a new practice, afterall. Expecting to see its impact immediately after your first practice may be a bit unrealistic. And yet, most of us have this exact expectation. We sit there for a few seconds after our first meditation, waiting for the lightbulb moment or to be overcome with an overwhelming sense of calm. We go into meditation with a cloud of expectation hovering over us and when our expectations aren‚Äôt met, we‚Äôre disappointed. Some of us even decide that meditation doesn‚Äôt work for us after just a few weeks. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Odds are, you had some sliver of expectations similar to what we just described, and you were expecting to feel different and perhaps renewed right after the first meditation. Maybe you were expecting to see your anxiety levels drop immediately or feel more compassion and &nbsp;understanding for those who normally bother you. Perhaps you thought your focus would improve or that you would feel more capable of from work. But after the first few meditations, you still haven‚Äôt noticed any visible changes. Because of this, you may think that meditation is only good for providing momentary relaxation. Or you may not have even experienced that  because just sitting still was making you feel too antsy and restless. Racing thoughts, resisting the urge to open your eyes or reach for the closest distraction‚Äîall of this is perfectly normal during your first few weeks of meditation.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-science-has-proven-about-meditation""><strong>What science has proven about meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Meditation is often perceived as a pain reliever that provides temporary relief, yet that‚Äôs not the case.  that has both short and long-term effects. Some of us may not notice these effects immediately after meditating for the first time, but scientific studies prove that as we continue to meditate regularly, our minds begin physically changing from our very first practice. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A study done at Yale University last August, for instance, was able to analyze the brains of its participants and detected an immediate difference in brain activity after just one practice. This isn‚Äôt the only study that has been conducted on individuals who tried meditation. Another study, published in the  demonstrates the beneficial effects of meditation on our minds. The study shows that these effects take place the minute we start our very first meditation practice. &nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">, an increasing number of scientists have begun researching the practice more and more. Many scientists began studying the positive effects meditation had on our cognitive abilities and our ability to focus. For instance, a study by the Catherine Norris &amp; Hedy Kober team demonstrated how 10 minute-long meditations affected participants who had never meditated before. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">For their research they divided 40 participants into 2 random groups of 20. One group did a 10-minute-long mindfulness meditation. The other group listened to a National Geographic article that was written in the same style. Following these sessions the two groups were given simple mental tests. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-quality-of-focus-improves-with-your-first-meditation""><strong>The quality of focus improves with your first meditation</strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">According to the study, the group that did a 10-minute meditation did much better on tests centered on . They also proved to be better at directing their focus after meditating. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This finding is crucial, principally because it proves that our first ever meditation is beneficial for us, even when we don‚Äôt notice its benefits. In other words, it shows that meditation takes effect the minute we sit down for our practice.</p>

Well, in the first stages of practicing meditation, small changes will begin to take place in our prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Gradually, meditation increases the mass of grey matter in our brains thereby improving performance-based qualities such as focus. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Put bluntly, meditation is not a vehicle that will transport you to a magical realm the minute you try it. Yet with time and consistency, you will absolutely begin to notice its impact on your overall demeanor, perspective, and physical state.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is precisely why it‚Äôs important that we trust in our meditation practice and make room for it in our lives, . Allowing ourselves to stay in this meditative space while keeping realistic and patient expectations for ourselves will help us attain a much clearer and more fulfilled mindset.</p>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>We‚Äôve all had moments when we felt extremely overwhelmed. At some point, we may have felt like everything was spiralling out of control. We may have even felt disoriented from all the things going on around us. . In such moments, we may have snapped at a friend or loved one. Once we calmed down a bit though, odds are that we walked up to them and apologized, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. I don‚Äôt know what came over me.‚Äù </p> 
   <p>The problem is exactly that: we don‚Äôt always know what comes over us. We don‚Äôt always know or consciously understand what emotions we‚Äôre experiencing. That‚Äôs why things like mindfulness meditation is so important ‚Äî it allows us to observe our emotions from a distance and truly comprehend them. Mindfulness meditation lets us keep track of our emotions and thus understand ourselves better.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-why-do-i-have-trouble-understanding-my-emotions""><strong>Why Do I Have Trouble Understanding My Emotions?</strong></h2> 
   <p>A general misconception about emotions is that they are hardwired into our brains. We believe that emotions just happen to us and we have no control over them. But this is simply not true: emotions are neither concrete nor hardwired. According to scientist Lisa Feldman Barrett, who has been studying emotions for the past 25 years, emotions are predictions our brains make about the physical sensations we feel.</p> 
   <p>For instance, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre about to take a very important test. Your heart is hammering in your chest before we go in. Your brain searches for a reason for this and says, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very anxious about this test‚Äù. Now that you‚Äôre convinced you‚Äôre anxious, you feel it more and more. You might even have trouble focusing on the exam and may get a low score simply due to these feelings. <br></p> 
   <p>But here‚Äôs the thing: in this scenario, your brain may have labelled your racing heartbeat as ‚Äúanxiety,‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt necessarily have to. You know another time your hearts beat faster? When you‚Äôre gearing up for something. When you‚Äôre preparing to do battle and take something on ‚Äî in other words, when you‚Äôre determined. <br></p> 
   <p>With this in mind, we see that it‚Äôs entirely possible to observe the physical sensations that we‚Äôre feeling, identify our brain‚Äôs label for that sensation and work towards changing that label. In other words, it‚Äôs possible to calm ourselves down and allow determination to replace anxiety. We can train our brains to interpret the sensations we feel and create different emotions in time.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-why-should-i-keep-track-of-my-emotions""><strong>Why Should I Keep Track of My Emotions?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Keeping track of our emotions helps us in a number of ways. First, it allows us to observe what kinds of sensations we experience in different situations and how we interpret those sensations. For example, what do you feel physically when you‚Äôre rushing to work or school? Is your heart beating fast? Do you feel stressed? Panicked? Or are you more detached? What do you experience when you argue with a friend?  Do you sometimes feel angry and indignant, even if you know the other person‚Äôs point might be valid? On the other hand, what feelings do you experience when you‚Äôre alone? Do you feel lonely, or do you feel comfortable doing things by yourself? <br></p> 
   <p>Keeping track of our physical sensations and emotions in these situations help us to understand ourselves in new ways. After a while, we begin to spot the patterns in our emotions and reactions. We might notice, for instance, that maybe we grow too agitated or angry when we get into an argument and feel the need to win, even when we‚Äôre wrong. Keeping track of our emotions not only helps us spot these patterns ‚Äî it also helps us change them. This process helps us remember what we‚Äôve observed about ourselves next time we‚Äôre in an argument and take a moment to calm ourselves. Instead of growing angry, we can choose to explore the problem calmly and listen to the other person‚Äôs perspective without growing angry and possibly damaging our relationship.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-can-i-train-my-brain-to-respond-differently""><strong>How Can I Train My Brain To Respond Differently?</strong></h2> 
   <p>There are a number of ways we can work to keep track of and change our emotions. The first is meditation. By doing mindfulness meditation on topics like anger or loneliness, we can become aware of our emotions and reactions in such situations. We can spot the patterns in our emotions and actively work towards solving them when we discover a problematic pattern.<br></p> 
   <p>Taking notes on our observations and journaling about them can also be a very effective way to keep track of our emotions. When we meditate, we become aware of certain things about ourselves. Writing down our newfound realizations is an excellent way to gain more insight into them. By exploring our emotions in a private environment, we can identify the root causes of problems over time and address them ourselves.<br></p> 
   <p>This is why journaling is regarded as an excellent tool for therapy by psychologists all over across the globe. According to a study done at the University of Rochester Medical Center, journaling is a great way to reduce anxiety, decrease stress, and cope with depression. It‚Äôs also very effective in helping us to prioritize our problems, concerns and fears ‚Äî it allows us to slow down our minds as we‚Äôre thinking about our emotions. By taking this time, we‚Äôre able to stop our feelings from spiralling out of control. &nbsp;Journaling is a scientifically-proven way of reinforcing positive thoughts and identifying negative thoughts and behaviors.<br></p>

   <p>Journaling is also important because our brains are hardwired to forget. Our brains can‚Äôt remember everything ‚Äî otherwise they‚Äôd get too crammed and we‚Äôd never get anything done.Whatever we ‚Äúforget‚Äù is generally stored in our subconscious. This is why we are prone to forgetting or disregarding what sensations are aroused in us in different situations and how we react to them. But noting down all these things soon after they happen can stop us from forgetting and help us to internalize our observations. It‚Äôs only once we do this that we can work towards change.<br></p> 
   <p>A last benefit of note taking and journaling is that it enables us to finally see our triggers. Writing down things that happen and how we emotionally respond to them helps us realize which events give rise to which emotions in us. This way when something we know will cause anxiety happens, we‚Äôll know why we‚Äôre feeling the way we‚Äôre feeling. Instead of spiraling out of control, we‚Äôll be able to take a step back and observe how we‚Äôre feeling. We‚Äôll be able to calm ourselves down and consider how we want to emotionally respond to this situation. Could the sensations that this situation is creating be interpreted another way? Can I change my outlook on it? Is it possible to transform this emotional distress? If not, how do I want to respond to the emotion I‚Äôm experiencing? <br></p> 
   <p>Simply changing how we think about our emotions and writing about them may seem like small steps, but in the end this process can have a big impact.. After all, taking notes on our realizations about our emotions, thoughts and behaviors helps us to explore both our emotions and ourselves. And in the end, it can help us have a better relationship not only with ourselves, but with the people close to us as well.<br></p>

Perfectionism: A Character Trait or a Fear? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Translator: Zeynep ≈ûen</p> 
   <p>Whether we realize it or not, so many of us are preys of perfectionism. Some of us take pride in this, going over each of our activities meticulously and wanting it to be perfect. Others of us feel paralyzed by the need to appear and seem perfectly fine to others; we get anxious thinking about how we seem to other people, what others think of our work, our potential, and performance. Regardless of how we view perfectionism, the question is worth asking: Is our perfectionism driven by our fear of being rejected or seen as unworthy? <br></p>

   <h2><strong>‚ÄúFear fuels perfectionism.‚Äù</strong></h2> 
   <p>This is a statement which was put forth by Dr. David D. Burnsh and which underpins the ideas we‚Äôll go over in this article. For those of us most addicted to perfectionism, the idea of being meticulous, productive, efficient, polished, poised, and successful is so warm and fuzzy. We may imagine a superhuman who can do everything so well; you‚Äôre widely loved and praised for your capabilities, performance, and can-do attitude‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs wrong with being like that? Well, sure those are all positive attributes, but it‚Äôs not necessarily doing those things that‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs what happens when we don‚Äôt do all of these things at the same time. We beat ourselves up internally, we‚Äôre unkind and impatient with ourselves, and we spend energy and emotions worrying about what impact it may have on others‚Äô opinions of us. <br></p> 
   <p>Those feelings of not being enough, failing, being a disappointment, and not doing your best can keep you from not only enjoying the present moment, but also learning to be in a healthy long-term relationship with yourself.</p> 
   <h2><strong>What Is the Road to Perfectionism Made Of?</strong> <br></h2> 
   <p>Perfectionism is trying to do whatever we‚Äôre responsible for in a perfect way. This approach, which leaves no room for mistakes, automatically devalues whatever we create should there be the slightest wrinkle or mistake. Reading these words, most of us can agree that it‚Äôs unreasonable and unrealistic to expect ourselves to do everything perfect, but on a day to day basis, it can be difficult for us to resist being hard on ourselves. Especially in a world with countless filters, staged photos, and photoshop, we want everything we do to look beautiful and polished. We spend an increasing amount of time wondering what others are thinking about us, which only drives us to perfect even more. It becomes less comfortable talking about our failures, imperfections, struggles, and flaws because we worry more about what people will think or say if they knew certain things about us. We fear disconnection and rejection. &nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>We have to admit this to ourselves; we are hardwired to want love, acceptance, approval, and connection. We yearn for others‚Äô acceptance of us and for genuine relationships. Most of us have always been brought up in a culture and home that pushes us to strive for perfection. Think of your childhood. If people weren‚Äôt telling us to get better grades, perform better at a sport, or apply our best selves to each activity, they were scolding us for not doing each activity better. Many of us grew up with the notion that being ourselves isn‚Äôt enough to be loved, that we have to make an extra effort and begin striving towards perfectionism at an early age. <br></p> 
   <p>In 2002, Dr. Gordon H. Flett and Dr. Paul L. Hewitt laid out 3 kinds of perfectionism:</p> 
   <ol> 
    <li><strong>Self-Directed Perfectionism: </strong>Setting impossible-to-meet expectations for yourself.</li> 
    <li><strong>Perfectionism Directed to Others:</strong> Expecting others to meet impossible standards and consequently refusing to give more responsibility to others, taking on more responsibility you‚Äôre able to or damaging a relationship because of mutual displeasure.</li> 
    <li><strong>Societal Perfectionism: </strong>Believing that certain standards cannot be met by individuals alone and trying to meet them all the more as a result. </li>

   <h2><strong>Perfectionism As A Weapon of Survival</strong></h2> 
   <p>Societal Perfectionism is probably the most impactful kind of perfectionism there is. According to a study done in the US after 1989, societal expectations of perfectionism put on the shoulders of the younger generations began to sharpen. As a result, younger generations have begun to feel that they‚Äôre inflicted to harsher criticism than past generations were and started to push themselves to impossible lengths just to prove themselves. <br></p> 
   <p>The competitive dynamic that this has created in the age that we live in has prioritized the group mind over that of the individual. These two factors have stoked the belief that ‚Äúwe need to work harder to be loved‚Äù and that we need to be ever more perfect, no matter how damaging, tiring and wearying that road may be.</p> 
   <p>This kind of behavior and mindset, which begins taking shape during our childhoods and picks up speed during adolescence seeps into adulthood as well. Think of all of the different times just during this past week when you‚Äôve felt like you didn‚Äôt do something well enough, when you wondered about what someone else thought of your work or life, or when you were obsessively trying to make something more perfect. <br></p> 
   <p>Ask yourself: how would you talk to a friend who was going through the same struggles, having the same thoughts, or beating themselves up the way you do yourself? Most of us would use much softer and kinder words with them; we would tell them they‚Äôre being silly to obsess over such a small thing. That everyone makes mistakes and that no one can do everything at the same time perfectly. So why don‚Äôt we talk to ourselves the same way?<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>The Perfection You‚Äôre Chasing After Isn‚Äôt Real</strong></h2> 
   <p>It‚Äôs impossible for any being, situation or individual to be perfect. Something or someone may seem perfect from the outside, but everyone has their own faults and assets. Everyone is unique and while this might not make us perfect, it does mean that we are all special in our own way. It means that we exist. <br></p> 
   <p>If we were to look at perfectionism from a scientific point of view, we‚Äôd be able to better understand nothing can be perfect. Some may claim that the Solar System we live in is perfect but that‚Äôs not the case. While the universe may be 9 billion years old, our solar system has only existed for the past 4,5 billion years. The sun has gone through incredibly violent, chaotic phases and while it may be relatively calm, one day it will disappear. Can we talk about perfection in an ever fluctuating, unstable design? One where energy is in constant motion, transformation and is trying to find its own way? Knowing that we will be a part of this flow of ups and down, can we be more patient and kinder to ourselves? Can we remind ourselves that we‚Äôre doing our best, and that even when we make mistakes, we‚Äôre growing and evolving in real time?<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Stop waiting for perfection to start living</strong></h2> 
   <p>What was the last thing you postponed when you were chasing after perfection? Which project did you stop yourself from taking on because you didn‚Äôt feel you were ready, not perfect enough to execute it? Waiting for perfection begets procrastination, discontent, confusion, and fear. Waiting to be perfect to start that business, or waiting for your finances to be perfect until you have a child, waiting to wear that bikini until your body looks perfect‚Äîby waiting for perfection, we rob ourselves of the present joys and sources of happiness and growth. <br></p> 
   <p>So, instead of chasing after a perfection which doesn‚Äôt really exist anyways, why not chase after the possibilities of today?</p> 
   <p>We‚Äôd love to hear from all of our Meditopia self-proclaimed perfectionists on how your inclination to do everything perfectly can stop you from new experiences and activities.<br></p> 
   <p>What‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôd like to start telling yourself whenever you feel like you‚Äôve made a mistake, not done your best, or failed. Let‚Äôs share with each other positive affirmations to express kindness and patience with ourselves!<strong><br><br></strong><br></p>

Changing Our Perspective on Failure üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <h2><strong>Failure: The Best Flavor Out There</strong></h2> 
   <p>How do you define failure? Here‚Äôs how world-renowned basketball player Michael Jordan defines it: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed over 9000 shots in my career, have been beaten in 300 matches, been entrusted with the matchpoint 26 times and missed them as well. I‚Äôve failed again and again and again and that is why I succeeded.‚Äù If Jordan had blamed himself after every missed shot and gotten hung up on his failures, would he have become the famous athlete that he is today? Failure is not an end. Quite the opposite, each failure is a step we take on the way to success, as well as a chance we can take to observe ourselves. <br></p> 
   <p>We are under immense pressure to be successful and meet certain criteria from the moment we‚Äôre born. This is a pressure that our family, friends and society imposes on us, often without realizing it. We grow up seeking adults‚Äô approval and attention and in time we begin to equate this praise and approval with success. As adults we are then determined to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù. But what does that mean exactly? How does one even measure success?<br></p> 
   <p>The definition of success generally changes from community to community and even person to person, based on their values, expectations and criteria. Individuals that are considered ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù are paraded in front of us on the news and social media, thereby engraving the rules and standards of success on our subconscious and conscious minds. We then find ourselves losing battles that we didn‚Äôt want to engage in, in the first place. Think about it, have you ever felt conflicted about what you find to be successful versus what others deem to be successful? If you have, this might be because of a conflict between what you really want and what you think you want. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p> 
   <p>Here‚Äôs the most important question you need to ask yourself in such a case: What are your criteria for success and how do you measure it? When do you feel successful and when do you feel like you‚Äôve failed? Are success and failure opposites or are they two different ways of looking at a certain set of circumstances?<br></p> 
   <p>It‚Äôs important that we take the time to answer these questions for ourselves and reshape our relationship to failure, because we each define failure in a different way. What are some of our most common preconceived notions of failure? Let‚Äôs look at them together. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Perfection is a big, fat lie</strong></h2> 
   <p>If you‚Äôre a perfectionist you might think you need to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù at whatever you‚Äôre doing on the first try. Perfection is so important to you that having to pause, giving yourself a break, trying something again, or even asking for help can be a small failure for you. But here‚Äôs the problem with that logic: Perfection doesn‚Äôt exist. It is, in fact, a big lie. It‚Äôs physically impossible for any living creature, situation or object to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or constantly perform ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù. Once you start to accept that and realize that you can only do anything to the best of your ability at the time, the negative connotation with failure will begin to evolve into a gentle nudge that life is giving you to try again.<strong><br></strong></p>

   <h2><strong>Failure reminds you to enjoy the ride</strong></h2> 
   <p>Failure can serve to remind you that you‚Äôre learning, growing, changing, and evolving. When we focus solely on ‚Äúsucceeding‚Äù, we may become blind to everything we‚Äôre experiencing and learning along the way. It‚Äôs like tunnel vision, where you can only see the endpoint and can‚Äôt seem to stop to enjoy the view. Yet that shouldn‚Äôt be the case with failure. When you fail, you‚Äôre given a chance to pause, look around, and look back at the path you‚Äôve taken and the decisions you‚Äôve made. It forces us to become more aware of ourselves and internalize lessons, values, and observations that we can then take with us as we move forward. In a way, failure can be the doorway to our biggest revelations if we regard it as such. <strong><br></strong></p> 
   <h2><strong>Failure can be beautiful</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-text-align-left"">When we start to change our perspective on failure, we may start to realize what a great opportunity it offers us. Sure, it‚Äôs easy to look back and smile at our failures when we‚Äôve finally succeeded or reached our goal. But can you smile at your failure as you‚Äôre experiencing it? I‚Äôm not suggesting that we jump for joy when we‚Äôve failed, but we can practice gratitude, patience, and compassion with ourselves when we‚Äôve failed. In doing so, we may find tiny doses of joy in tapping into our sense of resilience, recognizing what we‚Äôve learned, and what we‚Äôre capable of.<br></p> 
   <p>Enjoying the ride doesn‚Äôt just mean just enjoying the positive parts of a journey. It can also mean enjoying the whole journey, even its painful parts. Failure can make you focus on the road you‚Äôre on. This way, instead of thinking you‚Äôre headed for disaster, you can take stock and see that you‚Äôre alright. In such cases, it doesn‚Äôt matter that you‚Äôve failed. You‚Äôre not at the end of your journey and the path will continue forward. All you have to do is lift your head up, look forward, and continue on.</p> 
   <h2><strong>Failure adds flavor</strong></h2> 
   <p>Think of the best inspirational speeches you‚Äôve heard. What makes them so enticing and compelling? Failure. Failure is a flavor that‚Äôs appreciated by all palettes. Why? Because it‚Äôs indicative of so many values that we admire. To have faced failure and continued on requires courage, resilience, vulnerability, wisdom, and self-awareness. This also applies to yourself. <br></p> 
   <p>If you succeed in achieving a goal with minimal effort, no obstacles, challenges, or pain, it almost feels surreal, deflating, and dissatisfying when you‚Äôve obtained what you were working toward. Whether it‚Äôs because of our egos or just our nature, it seems to feel so much more gratifying, satisfying, and fulfilling when you can look back and see how much you overcame to get to where you are. If life is an already delicious dish we‚Äôre working our way through, failure is that extra special spice or sauce that just adds to the whole dining experience. Failure can make the experience that you‚Äôre having all the more valuable and memorable. <strong><br></strong></p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">

   <h2><strong>You‚Äôre still learning</strong></h2> 
   <p>If you‚Äôre a perfectionist or accept defeat the minute you stumble, please take note: Failure is the best teacher we can have. ‚ÄúAn example is better than precept,‚Äù as the old proverb goes. If you‚Äôve made a mistake, you can always learn from it and use what you learned on the way to success. Who knows? You might not have learned something that will prove invaluable to you on your path, had you not failed. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Training your ego to embrace failure</strong></h2> 
   <p>Failure can also remind us that there is a life outside of ourselves. It can make us realize that we can‚Äôt always have what we want when we want it. This is not a bad thing: It‚Äôs just a different lesson that failure can teach us or rather to our ego: ‚ÄúYou are not the only person with wants, desires, and goals. There are other people who want to succeed as well.‚Äù In reminding us of this, failure can help you to reexamine yourself, as well as observe the lives of others.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Failure helps you to remember who‚Äôs really at the wheel</strong></h2> 
   <p>The fact that there‚Äôs life outside of your own, or that you‚Äôre not the center of the universe, doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre not in control. You have the power to determine your own path, even if your ego is taking a beating at the same time. You are in the driver‚Äôs seat of your own life. You decide which way you want to go, no matter what happens. Any failures you have along the way can help you see that you should change course. It may even make you see that you‚Äôve set out prematurely and therefore turn back. And remember, there‚Äôs a big difference between walking away from something of your own, free will and quitting it because you‚Äôre unsure. Failure can help you see this and realize that the goal you set for yourself isn‚Äôt for you or wasn‚Äôt set by you. Failure gives us the chance to uncover other paths we can take, other goals that we can set for ourselves and ways to start over. What‚Äôs important here is your attitude and point of view because these are the things that will be your lifelong teacher and open new doors for you in the future.<br></p>

In your opinion, what are some of the most positive aspects failure has to offer us? Have you always viewed failure as a learning opportunity or is that something you‚Äôre still working on? </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Some of us are waiting to wake up one day and be struck by a revelation of what we must do with our lives. Some of us may feel guilty that we don‚Äôt feel fulfilled and satisfied with a good-paying, important job, or one of the many roles we play as mother, father, partner, friend, or mentor. Others of us have submitted to the idea that we may never have that lightening bulb moment. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">And should we be surprised by these thoughts? No. Why? Because since our childhood we‚Äôve been hearing from our parents, guardians, teachers, and coaches that we need to find our true calling and meaning in our lives. We‚Äôve watched influential leaders throughout the world give charismatic speeches about how they found their passion and because of that were able to . Our teachers would ask us what we wanted to be when we grew up, as if there was a specific destination we were meant to reach in order to feel complete, and purposeful. We have completed stage after stage of our lives, seeking out this elusive feeling of fulfillment and meaning, and yet many of us still feel as though we haven‚Äôt found it‚Äîas if there is something to be found at all. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Yet here‚Äôs a question we can consider. What if our life purpose is not one static passion or destination, but rather an ongoing process? Rather than seeking out or chasing after our life‚Äôs purpose, our purpose may be present right in this moment. In practicing mindfulness, we give ourselves the opportunity to begin learning more about what motivates us, what makes us feel enthusiastic and passionate, and what behaviors we can adopt to help us feel more engaged in .</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So for just these next few minutes, let‚Äôs set aside the idea that our life purpose is a destination, passion, or talent we must uncover.

   <h2 id=""h-where-are-you-now""><strong>Where are you now?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Oftentimes when we‚Äôre thinking of our life purpose, our mind immediately goes to the future. We start conjuring up this image of ourselves, smiling, fully engaged in whatever we‚Äôre doing, walking with confidence, carrying ourselves with peace of mind and self-assurance. Yet while enticing, that visual is just a snapshot of a moment that can only come to pass if you choose to do the emotional and mental work <em>now</em>. Similar to any process of growth and development in our lives, we cannot make that visualization into a reality without doing the spiritual and mental work first.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That work starts in the now. The present moment is the only reality we can work with, without reliving the past through our own filter or hypothesizing what the future may bring. We can‚Äôt know how far it is we need to go without knowing where we are now and without . To reflect on this, try to carve out some time for yourself on a consistent basis, when you have minimal distractions around you; it could even be when you‚Äôre taking a shower, washing the dishes, or cleaning up the house. Ideally it would be sitting in a relaxing spot where you can sit silently without any disruptions.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">During these moments, try to see yourself from afar, as if you were a stranger observing yourself. We‚Äôre much better at observing and judging the behaviors of others than ourselves. You could even name that person you‚Äôre viewing objectively as someone different from you. As you look in on this person‚Äôs daily routine and habits, notice what judgements and  emerge. Watch them as they‚Äôre at work, going through each task, participating in meetings, and talking with customers and colleagues. Then as objectively as possible, consider the person you‚Äôre watching and how they are impacting the world around them. Who is that person, how do they behave, and what do they like to do?</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If it helps, you can write down your observations of this person, the good and the bad. Give yourself permission to be honest with yourself, without taking any of your observations personally. This process and this journey is only between you and <em>you</em>, so consider yourself worthy and deserving of your own honesty and reflections. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Still viewing ourselves from afar, objectively, consider whether this person‚Äôs decisions and behaviors are their own or if they are reflections of what this person believes is expected from them. Now, we all pick up certain expectations, norms, and perspectives as we grow up and evolve, yet every now and then each of us faces a resistance between what we want and what we think others want or expect from us. The most classic example comes from our parents‚Äô expectations. Sure, some of their expectations seem to flow along with our own wants and aspirations, yet every so often there can be friction; the line between what they want and what we want can be blurred. This can happen with our friends, our mentors, and partners. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Similarly the assumptions and opinions imposed upon us throughout our lives can become the leading narrators in our minds. For example, if we were constantly told we were bad at mathematics growing up, we may have concluded long ago that we would never be any good at math. Likewise, people may have always complimented you on your artistic creativity growing up; that can also be a narrative and filter you carry with you up until today. Those stories and narratives thus live on into our current lives and impact our current decisions. Think about what stories and opinions, both negative and positive, that have stuck with you up until now. </p>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Going back to our observations of this person you‚Äôre viewing objectively, consider whether the current life they lead, and the decisions and behaviors they currently engage in are more to satisfy the expectations of others rather than of themselves. What habits and paths might they feel a constant resistance toward, yet continue to follow? </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Again, this can be a conversation only between you and yourself. However uncomfortable or disturbing it may feel, challenge yourself to think about this and don‚Äôt judge yourself; each and every one of us, at some point or another, has done something in our lives solely for the purpose of satisfying the expectations of others.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-do-you-want-to-see-yourself""><strong>How do you want to see yourself? </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These questions and reflections on your current self and how much of that is in line with what you think you want versus what you really want leads us to another big question. That is‚Äîhow do you want to see yourself? If you were able to shed your occupation, your relationships, and roles, what would you like to see in and about yourself? We‚Äôre keeping this question intentionally vague because we want to be able to allow whatever images, values, feelings, or sensations to emerge on their own.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Some of us may see ourselves as humble, kind, and joyful while others may picture ourselves assertive, courageous, and steadfast. We may picture ourselves doing a specific activity we‚Äôd love to spend more time on, or in a new environment that challenges and excites us. We may even picture ourselves embodying the values and habits we wish we lived by more often. Whatever it is that we‚Äôre imagining, let that serve as a clue to what your many purposes are.</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs often said by many thought leaders and influencers that the actions that we find easiest and most intuitive to take are all clues to what we should be doing in our lives. Consider what forms of value you bring to yourself and those around you? What would others say about your attributes and contributions? It may be that you‚Äôre an incredible listener, that you are able to fix anything, that you‚Äôre pragmatic and reasonable, or that you‚Äôre generous and assertive. Whatever it may be, how can you use those innate skills and talents of yours more often? If you were to use those talents more often, what would that mean for your current life as it is? However uncomfortable or uneasy that answer is, we owe it to ourselves to face it and at least acknowledge it.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-will-finding-my-life-purpose-make-me-happy""><strong>Will finding my life purpose make me happy?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In our quest to understand our purpose on this Earth and in this life, we often assume that when we‚Äôre living out our life purpose, we‚Äôll be happy. Yet consider this; does every action that  and satisfaction make you feel happy while or after you‚Äôre doing it? </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We may be disappointed when we realize that not everything we‚Äôre here to do in this life is joy-filled and pleasant. And, in fact, by making happiness and joy a criteria of defining our many purposes, we limit ourselves from seeing all of the impacts, big and small, we have already made and can continue to make. Happiness, like all other feelings, is fleeting and temporary. Satisfaction and fulfillment gleaned from an experience or action, on the other hand, continues to live within us and offer us insight, peace of mind, and clarity.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Challenge yourself to consider this; think of a few projects, jobs, or activities you‚Äôve done recently that weren‚Äôt necessarily fun, but gave you great satisfaction and fulfillment. Think of the people, things, or situations in your life that bring you the most satisfaction and notice if there are any common threads that run through each of them.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-our-purpose-is-a-path-not-a-destination""><strong>Our purpose is a path, not a destination.</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As we think about the answers and thoughts that emerge to each of these questions and considerations, we can keep in mind that it‚Äôs okay if more than one specific goal, direction, or passion rises to the surface. It‚Äôs normal to feel pulled in different directions; we‚Äôre each so complex and multifaceted that of course different parts of us will gravitate toward different influences. So while it‚Äôs our tendency to seek out one purpose or goal, let us not forget to also pause from time to time to notice the present moment and just <em>be</em>. Perhaps, after all, our biggest overarching purpose is to explore inside of ourselves and strive to understand our own being. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Allow all of these different passions, common values, and interests to create a path for you that encourages you to manifest the type of experiences that will reap those same interests. Our life purpose isn‚Äôt necessarily a destination, it‚Äôs the path we construct for ourselves, piece by piece. Let those experiences shape you as you understand yourself more and more. Consider your life to be a mosaic that you have the creativity, power, and opportunity to put together little by little with the bits and pieces that catch your eye and speak to you.<br></p>

The Internal Commencement Speech üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Senior year of college is a very exciting time‚Äîit‚Äôs also pretty nerve-racking. It‚Äôs the last year we‚Äôre going to be at whichever college we‚Äôve chosen. The last time we‚Äôre ever going to see many of the people that we‚Äôve spent at least 4 years with. It‚Äôs a time for change and transformation, and perhaps the last step in our childhood before we set out into the world and begin our chosen career paths. Because, after all, after 4 years of college we know exactly what we want to do with our lives. At least, we‚Äôre expected to.<br></p> 
   <p>But here‚Äôs the thing: most of us have no clue what we‚Äôre going to do once we graduate. If we‚Äôre lucky, we have a vague idea of which direction we want to take. This is doubly true for those of us who haven‚Äôt studied concrete subjects and chose to major in philosophy or English literature, without wanting to be a professor in either field. So, when graduation rolls around, we‚Äôre left with one, major question: What the hell am I going to do with my life? We tend to panic when we ask ourselves this question, feeling like we have to know exactly what we want and who we are right now. Though here‚Äôs the big secret: You don‚Äôt have to. As scary as this may be, it‚Äôs ok not to know what you want to do with your lives yet. What‚Äôs not ok is not giving ourselves the time and space to sit with ourselves, listen to the flow of thoughts and feelings happening within us, and working to tap into our truest essence. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Recharging your batteries after graduating</strong></h2> 
   <p>In 3, 5 or 10 years, we may look back on our college days and wish we could go back. But let‚Äôs be honest, as fun as it is, college is no walk in the park. Between finals, papers, midterms, part-time jobs, presentations and yes job hunting, it‚Äôs tiring enough to be considered lethal‚Äîand that doesn‚Äôt even take the partying into account. We have so much to do, particularly in our senior year that sometimes we don‚Äôt notice just how mentally tired we are. It‚Äôs easy to keeping going at full speed until we reach graduation day and find ourselves feeling burnt out and directionless.<br></p> 
   <p>By graduation many of you may be feeling mentally and physically exhausted. &nbsp;Odds are that the last year of college has a huge toll on you and contrary to how we may sometimes feel, we are not machines. You can‚Äôt keep working in perpetuum, for an eternity. In fact, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to do so even if you were a machine. Think of your mind as a computer: If a computer were to overheat, you‚Äôd give it a break or at the very least put a fan underneath it. So, perhaps it‚Äôs a good idea to consider that period between your graduation and when you start looking for a job as a grace period: a time for you to truly get the rest you deserve. A time for you to ask yourself, ‚ÄòWho am I?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhat kind of work do I want to get involved in?‚Äô<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Who Am I?</strong></h2> 
   <p>We human beings may not be able to work in perpetuum, but we are perpetually changing. The experiences we accumulate day to day, month to month and year to year change and transform us. So, simply put, you are not the same person you were on your first day of college. You‚Äôve changed, grown and transformed in ways you probably don‚Äôt even realize and because of this your wants, expectations, and desires have changed as well.<br></p> 
   <p>College is a hectic environment even during the best of times. And yet, while it‚Äôs one of the best places for growth and transformation, it‚Äôs not necessarily the best place for you to observe and reflect on that change. It‚Äôs a whirlwind of classes, trips, social interactions, internships, and new opportunities that have such an enormous impact on who we are and yet after graduation, we rarely give ourselves time to step back, look at ourselves and acknowledge who we‚Äôve become. Without that awareness around who we are, what values drive us, what types of projects and activities motivate and excite us, how can we determine which direction to move towards? <br></p> 
   <p>If you‚Äôre lucky to have a short period of time after college, even if it‚Äôs just a long weekend, give yourself the space and time to figure this out. Give yourself the time to rest your mind and also begin asking yourself.<br></p> 
   <p>Who am I? What do I enjoy? What gives me joy? What am I good at? What have I learned about what I like to do and about myself? Meditation is a perfect way of exploring such questions without pressuring yourself with them. Journaling or taking notes on what you discover about yourself is also a very helpful way of expanding on your thoughts and inclinations. In doing so, not only can you discover aspects of yourself and your abilities, but you can also begin exploring how you can also begin experimenting with them to figure out what you want to do in life.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Experimentation and Discovery After Graduation</strong></h2> 
   <p>If we have a few days or even a few months off between graduation and our next program, project or job, it can be such an advantage for us. Though if we let that grace period drag on too long, we run the risk of letting it become a crutch. While it is important to take this time to both rest and discover ourselves, when we‚Äôre ready, it‚Äôs equally important to get moving again. That doesn‚Äôt mean we need to know what we want to do. It‚Äôs ok if we don‚Äôt. Though you may find that by participating and engaging in any type of project, mission or job, you‚Äôll begin to quickly sort out what appeals to you and what doesn‚Äôt. Knowledge and self-awareness come with experience, and the best way to have that experience is to dive right into new situations, projects, and roles.<br></p> 
   <p>This is why it‚Äôs important to experiment. Apply for internships, chase after volunteer opportunities, interview for a variety of jobs that pertain to what you‚Äôve studied in college, try to find opportunities that allow you to utilize your skills and interests.</p> 
   <p>Remember, you don‚Äôt have to get stuck in the first job that you get, especially if that job is more about getting your boss coffee and less about giving you an opportunity to learn and grow.<br></p> 
   <p>I know these first steps always seem the most stressful. With so many directions and options before us, it can feel paralyzing to consider which one to choose. The fear of making the wrong decision can feel so heavy, as if one wrong job offer will ruin the entire course of your life. Yet bear with me for a moment, let‚Äôs try something together. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Been there. Done that. </strong></h2> 
   <p>Take a moment to think about a time in your past when you felt an incredible amount of stress and anxiety. It may have been over making a decision or facing a big challenge. Take a few moments to consider what was causing you so much stress and how you felt at that point. <br></p> 
   <p>Now, take a step back from that situation. Look at it from a distance, from where you are in your life now. Does the same situation feel as stressful or heavy right at this moment? Perhaps you may even smile to yourself, shake your head and wonder why you were so stressed out about that situation in the first place. Whatever decision you made, however you managed that situation, here you are, reading for personal development, motivation, and pleasure.<br></p> 
   <p>This isn‚Äôt to say that the decisions you make aren‚Äôt important. What I mean is that it‚Äôs helpful to look at all of the options before you with the knowledge that whatever you decide won‚Äôt make or break the life you have before you. Life is transient and ever-changing. You will change jobs, shift passions, discover new talents, encounter different opportunities, and even change yourself. What will define your peace of mind, success, and happiness isn‚Äôt just about the next step you take, it‚Äôs about the attitude and awareness with which you take it. <br></p>

   <h2><strong>Speed Doesn‚Äôt Equal Success</strong></h2> 
   <p>Odds are that you‚Äôre going to feel pressured to find a job at some point after graduation. You might feel a bit panicked like you‚Äôre wasting your time or running out of time. Take a deep breath whenever you feel like this. Remind yourself that neither is true. You have an abundance of time before you. So, despite the pressure you put yourself under, you don‚Äôt have to rush into the first job you find. What you want is to find the best job for you, one where you‚Äôll be able to learn, grow and excel.<br></p> 
   <p>Think of it like this: Would you rather immediately accept the job where you‚Äôll mostly be stuck doing coffee runs and mail delivery or would you rather keep looking until you find a position that‚Äôll enable to use what you‚Äôve learned in college and add value to the company you‚Äôll be in? Where do you think you‚Äôll be and feel more valued? Where do you want to take your first steps in your professional career? As scary as it may seem, taking a job in a role that seems over your head and very challenging will stretch your intellectual and talent muscles more than an easy job that you know you could do in your sleep. <br></p> 
   <p>Another point to consider is the external pressure and expectations that are closing in on each of us. Make a conscious effort not to be overwhelmed by your friends‚Äô so-called early successes or your family‚Äôs expectations. This is not a sprint or a race, this is a marathon. It is a long journey with just one participant and one person to compete against‚Äîthat‚Äôs you. The desires, expectations, and dreams of others shouldn‚Äôt sway your decisions and behaviors more than the desires and dreams of your own. Trust in life‚Äôs power to offer you new opportunities because as you become more and more self-aware of what motivates and drives you, you will begin to manifest more opportunities that align with those passions.</p> 
   <h2><strong>Gratitude for the Present as You Make Your Way Forward</strong></h2> 
   <p>You might be thinking: That‚Äôs all well and good, but it‚Äôs easier said than done lady. It can be difficult to remember all of this, especially if you can‚Äôt seem to be able to find the right opportunity for you. One thing that could be very helpful to you at this point is to remind yourself of all the experiences, opportunities, people, and projects you‚Äôve had up until this point that you‚Äôre grateful for. For starters, you‚Äôre one of the privileged few in the world that were able to receive a college education: Only 6.7% of the world population has a college degree. For better or worse, you have family or friends that love and support you. You have a warm roof over your head, even if you are sharing it with someone like, say, a roommate or your parents.<br></p> 
   <p>These are just the basic things we have that we often take for granted. You can take this a step further and start writing down a list of everything you have to be grateful for. You can also meditate on gratitude; a practice that will keep you grounded in the present, as you make your way into the future.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-is-a-habit-anyways""><strong>What Is A Habit Anyways?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">A habit is defined as a settled, regular tendency or practice. The more regular it is, the harder it is to give up. This habit could be any number of things: Drinking a cup of coffee at breakfast, having a smoke right after lunch, enjoying a midnight snack every night, watching TV every night after work‚Ä¶ Good or bad, these behaviors are fixed parts of our lives, but whatever they may be, they are made up of three stages: The Cue, The Routine and The Reward.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-the-cue""><strong>The Cue</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you‚Äôve ever read a theatre script, you‚Äôve most likely encountered these phrases: cue the lights, cue the music‚Ä¶ A cue signals for an action to be taken. For example, if we‚Äôre in the habit of having coffee when we wake up, then turning the coffee machine on might be our cue. Or if we always smoke after lunch, then ordering a coffee to go with our smoke may be our cue. Whatever our cues may be, if we take the time to observe our habits from a distance, we can see that they almost always start with the same one.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-the-routine""><strong>The Routine</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Our routine is the behavior we automatically engage in, once we receive our cue. We‚Äôre a bit like actors in this respect. The lights go on and we know exactly where to go on stage, what hand gestures to do and what lines to speak. And we rarely deviate. </p> 
   <h3 id=""h-the-reward""><strong>The Reward</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The reward is the enjoyment or ‚Äúfix‚Äù that we get from our habit. We don‚Äôt always necessarily feel happy or fulfilled about it, but on a basic level, we‚Äôre satisfied. The smell and taste of that coffee, how it feels drawing in that first breath from our smoke‚Ä¶</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-can-we-change-our-habits-and-adopt-new-ones""><strong>How can we change our habits and adopt new ones?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Changing our habits or adopting new ones like meditation takes a conscious effort. We have to actively make sure to include this new habit into our lives on a consistent basis until  form a link between that routine and its cue. The more we engage in this routine after our cue, the stronger that link becomes and the harder it is to break our habit.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-change-your-routine""><strong>Change your routine</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Swapping one routine for another is an easier way of changing habits. For example, let‚Äôs say we want to stop drinking coffee first thing in the morning. In order to be able to do so, we must first change our morning routine. If our routine is to turn the coffee machine on right after we wake up, then replacing it with some other activity, like boiling water for a cup of tea will help us a great deal. By not engaging in the cue that starts off our routine, we‚Äôll be able to disengage from that routine. And by filling the space of time we normally devote to our habit to something else, like drinking tea instead of coffee we will be able to weaken our habit and thus break it in time. Some other scenarios might look like this: Instead of having an alcoholic drink every night, make yourself a virgin cocktail instead. Instead of looking at your phone every night before bed, read a book or magazine in bed. Instead of reaching for a bag of cookies, first try to eat some fruit with dark chocolate. These small shifts in our habits can end up making a big difference in the long-run. </p>

   <h3 id=""h-be-patient""><strong>Be Patient</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There‚Äôs a common misconception that it takes 21 days to form a habit. This isn‚Äôt necessarily true. In some cases, it can take 21 days to change or adopt a new habit, like drinking a glass of water before having breakfast. In other cases, however, it can take us longer. According to a recent study done by the University College of London, it actually can take up to 66 days. Why? Because some habits are harder to pick up or break than others. Additionally, some people are genetically more resistant to adopting new habits and breaking old ones. That being said, it‚Äôs important that we are patient with ourselves when we‚Äôre trying to make changes in our daily lives. Beating yourself up and being hard on yourself when you have any setbacks is not as helpful to you as pausing and trying to understand what triggered you to engage in your old habits. If you binged on a bag of cookies, rather than criticizing yourself, ask yourself what emotions, , and situations triggered that binge. If you smoked a cigarette after two weeks of quitting, take a moment to observe the thoughts and emotions that led to you buying that new pack. Just because we‚Äôre having a difficult time and falling every now and then doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre failing at what we‚Äôre trying to do. If that were the case, none of us would have been able to learn to walk when we were infants, not after the number of times we tried to get up to our feet and fell back down. So be patient with yourself. You deserve it. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Every one of us has habits we wish we could change. Many of us have successfully adopted new habits, quit old ones and are right now in the midst of trying to change current routines. If you think about it, we‚Äôve been doing this our whole lives; switching from diapers to underwear, a bottle to a cup, school life to work life, and the many adjustments we must make when we decide to have a family. We know how to shift and change our habits already, yet most of the time it‚Äôs because we have no choice‚Äîthat certainly makes it a lot easier. Yet let‚Äôs challenge ourselves. Right now, identify one habit you want to change and consider what the future ‚Äòyou‚Äô looks like without this habit. How will changing this habit change your life and routine? What are some other habits you can swap with that habit? If you‚Äôd like, you can write what the habit is on a piece of paper and place it somewhere that may be your cue to act on that habit. If it‚Äôs eating junk food, put it near the pantry, if it‚Äôs smoking, put it on your computer screen or in your wallet, if it‚Äôs looking at your phone before bed, place it next to your bedside. You are worth the effort to change this habit and the future you will be grateful for it!<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As always, we‚Äôd love to hear your comments and suggestions on effective ways you‚Äôve found to help you change certain habits and adopt new ones. We‚Äôd also love to know if meditation has helped you change any habits and if so, how? <br><br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Marilyn Monroe once said that ‚Äúwanting to be someone else is a waste of the person that you are.‚Äù But let‚Äôs face it, we‚Äôve all been there: We‚Äôve all looked at someone else and wanted to be in their shoes. And more than any other aspect of modern life, social media fuels this feeling.<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-is-social-media-robbing-us-of-our-joy""><strong>Is social media robbing us of our joy?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Scrolling for hours through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter has become one of the great pastimes of the twenty-first century. We like selfie upon selfie and leave comments on pictures upon pictures of vacations, hangouts, and dates. As great a tool as it is for staying connected to the people in our lives, social media also has a harmful side. A study conducted at the University of Copenhagen, for instance, found that people who frequently use Facebook experience what scientists have dubbed ‚ÄúFacebook envy.‚Äù Their study showed that the more time we spend scrolling and liking, the more we compare ourselves to others and the more we envy them:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em>‚ÄúI wish I went on cool vacations like that.‚Äù</em></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em> ‚ÄúI wish I were dating someone who would cook for me ‚Äî actually, I wish I were dating anyone at all!‚Äù</em></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""><em>‚ÄúGod she‚Äôs pretty. She‚Äôs way prettier than me. I bet she‚Äôs much cooler too!‚Äù</em></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The more we have these thoughts, the more we seek validation by adding our own photos into the mix. Instead of spending meaningful time with our friends, we take a group photo to show just how much fun we‚Äôre having. Instead of spending some time with ourselves, we search for the perfect filter for our selfie. We tweet about what an amazing time we‚Äôre having at the beach ‚Äî and in the process, we miss the sunset. This is exactly how we create a ‚Äúmask.‚Äù We disguise self-esteem issues through selfies with pursed lips or flexed muscles. Instead of being present in a conversation, we check how many likes our most recent post has racked up‚Ä¶ Our vacation pictures say ‚ÄúSee, I go cool places too!‚Äù The pictures of us with our friends declare ‚ÄúI‚Äôm social. I‚Äôm liked.‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">But all these posts and shares don‚Äôt actually make us feel better about ourselves. We don‚Äôt suddenly start feeling prettier when we share a selfie, especially if we think that that selfie hasn‚Äôt gotten enough likes. We don‚Äôt feel cooler or more well-liked when we tweet and post other snippets of our lives, either. But we do create a beautiful mirage. We look happy. We look fulfilled. We look like we‚Äôre achieving something, even if we don‚Äôt feel that the image measures up to what‚Äôs really happening in our lives.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This can be especially true in the case of social media influencers ‚Äî in other words, people who have a ton of followers and seem to lead perfect lives. Take Latina influencer Jessica Torres: &nbsp;Looking at her pictures, you‚Äôd think she has an amazing life. She always looks happy and positive in her photos. But consider what she revealed in a recent interview:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúI fell into a depressive episode and cried for days, feeling unworthy of what I did and what I was representing online. I felt inadequate and constantly questioned every little thing I did.&nbsp;I thought it was just me feeling this pressure to constantly stay relevant online and to create content.‚Äù</p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote has-text-align-left""> 
    <p> <strong>We disguise self-esteem issues through selfies with pursed lipsor flexed muscles. Instead of being present in a conversation, we check how many likes our most recent post has racked up‚Ä¶</strong> </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Does that sound familiar? The truth is that we all experience these feelings in some form or fashion. All those people we‚Äôre comparing ourselves to ‚Äì be they our friends or even celebrities ‚Äî are in the same boat as us. They may post very cool images and selfies or tweet really funny things, but they‚Äôre creating mirages of their own. Our friends whose profiles we‚Äôre jealous of may even be scrolling through their own news feeds right now, comparing their lives to our ‚Äúperfect‚Äù life. They might be looking at our Instagram and Twitter, thinking ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I have this much free time?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I hang out at the beach?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy isn‚Äôt there a cute guy like that to take me out on a date? What am I doing wrong?‚Äù</p>

   <h2 id=""h-you-are-enough""><strong>You Are Enough</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The reason such thoughts pop into our heads and derail our mental health is because sometimes we aren‚Äôt able to see ourselves clearly. We aren‚Äôt always able to see the blessings and beauty in our lives. We focus on other people‚Äôs lives, thinking they‚Äôre better ‚Äî and in the process suffer from anxiety, depression and feelings of inadequacy, especially when social media is involved. &nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So how can we learn to see ourselves clearly, show compassion to ourselves and be grateful for all that we have? The answer to that doesn‚Äôt lie in the mask and mirage we‚Äôve created on social media. It also doesn‚Äôt lie in the self-doubt and self-criticism we‚Äôve mired ourselves in. It lies in giving ourselves a little break.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I mean ‚Äúgiving ourselves a break‚Äù in two ways. First, we need to take a break from social media. If we‚Äôre constantly comparing ourselves to others and feeling inadequate and unhappy as a result, then perhaps it really is time to cut back on our scrolling time. We spend so much time focusing on the lives of others and creating a beautiful fiction for ourselves that we lose sight of ourselves and our lives. Sometimes we do such a good job of creating this online fiction that we repress things we are actually going through in our lives.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We can look to celebrities as an example of people who have perfect-looking social media profiles, but who still deal with issues that we all do. For instance, the actress Selena Gomez most recently made headlines because she was hospitalized for anxiety. When we think ‚Äúcelebrity‚Äù we tend to think ‚Äúperfection‚Äù. We are under the impression that they have everything and are incredibly happy, all the time. Though Selena Gomez‚Äôs social media accounts were full of pretty snippets of her interesting life, it doesn‚Äôt show the whole story of her experiences ‚Äî which are much more ordinary and closer to the issues many of us struggle with.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Following her attack, Gomez took a break from social media, saying:</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">‚ÄúAs much as I am grateful for the voice that social media gives each of us, I am equally grateful to be able to step back and live my life in the present moment I have been given.‚Äù</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Taking a break from social media, then, is not only a good way to refocus our perspective of ourselves but to concentrate on how to live life fully and in the moment.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-self-acceptance""><strong>Self-Acceptance</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">So, why do we have such a problem accepting ourselves? Well, every individual is different. We all have various issues that we deal with and underlying causes that fuel them. Therefore, if we want to learn to accept ourselves, we need to meditate on acceptance itself. Meditation is not about having nothing in one‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs about observing the thoughts we have, letting them drift by and seeing their causes. Put another way, it‚Äôs realizing that our reaction to the thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really ugly‚Äù is unraveling with more thoughts like ‚ÄúMy nose is too big. My eyebrows are too bushy. My hair is unmanageable,‚Äù etc. instead of letting the thought pass by and try to understand where and why it came to us. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Guided acceptance meditations, like the ones in the Acceptance Series on Meditopia, don‚Äôt solely teach us how to observe such thought patterns. They also show us how to bring ourselves back to the present moment with specific, positive mantras, like: ‚ÄúI am enough. I am doing enough. I have enough.‚Äù</p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p> <strong>Meditation is not about having nothing in one‚Äôs head. It‚Äôs about observing the thoughts we have, letting them drift by and seeing their causes.</strong> </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">By bringing ourselves back to the moment, we can refocus on the reality of ourselves. We can discover what we‚Äôre really like, what attributes we have, what people love about us and most importantly, why we‚Äôre deserving of our own love and compassion. In the words of Sharon Salzberg, ‚ÄúYou can search throughout the entire universe for someone who is more deserving of your love and affection than you are yourself and that person is not to be found anywhere. You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This is a topic that we‚Äôd love to start a larger conversation about. As a growing part of our population, our children, are becoming increasingly exposed and connected to social media platforms. It‚Äôs therefore our responsibility to better understand the implications of those habits on our younger generations. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As always, we‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts and comments on this topic. Have you ever found yourself comparing your life to those you see on social media? How do you think we can educate ourselves as well as our younger generation on how to maximize the beneficial aspects of social media while minimizing the negative impacts?</p>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>When I initially started meditating, I was surprised at how judgemental and vocal people were about it. I was often accused of only meditating ‚Äúfor the gram‚Äù or because it‚Äôs become a new trend in pop culture. After hearing this so many times, I now generally keep quiet about this habit of mine, unwilling to see faces of judgement or doubt. Between people who believe it to be another snake-charming trick and people who only do it for a cool Instagram picture, I‚Äôm made to feel as though I‚Äôm doing something either out of vanity or because I‚Äôve ‚Äòfallen for a trick‚Äô. Frankly, though, I‚Äôve gotten to a point now where the benefits I experience from  have convinced me to come out and announce my devotion to this practice! So here it goes.

   <p>It should come as no surprise to anyone that meditation is seen as the ‚Äúhot, new thing‚Äù. You log onto Instagram and immediately see three posts of people meditating in the lotus position. You go on Twitter and one of the first Tweets on your newsfeed is inevitably about how great meditation is. Now, I‚Äôm clearly not against meditation. Nor am I against people sharing their experiences with meditation. In fact, I‚Äôm glad they do. I find it to be a good way of sharing with others something that‚Äôs been beneficial for you. However, while there are so many people share their experiences like this, there are a group of people that have come to view meditation as merely a fad‚Äîsomething trendy that ‚Äúmillennials‚Äù get hooked on for a while.</p> 
   <p>This often puts a negative connotation in the word ‚Äòmeditation‚Äô and makes me feel uncomfortable even uttering the words ‚ÄúI meditate‚Äù. Over time, I‚Äôve become accustomed to hearing questions like ‚ÄúReally? You‚Äôre into that?‚Äù or back-handed comments like ‚ÄúOh, so you‚Äôre going along with the hipster fad now, huh?‚Äù. Hearing these types of comments can be unsettling and frustrating. It‚Äôs not only unfair to me and others who have experienced such powerful benefits from meditation, but it also does a disservice to meditation as a topic. Meditation can have tremendous benefits for people‚Äôs mental and physical health, and to shame those who are trying to practice these techniques can prevent others who really need it from trying. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-history-of-meditation""><strong>The History of Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p>The idea the meditation is a trend implies that it‚Äôs new, and yet that couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth. Meditation is actually one of the oldest practices in the world. The earliest references to it can be traced back to paintings of people in the lotus position around 5000 BCE. The earliest references to breath focus meditation, however, come from the Rig Veda, around 1200 BCE. </p> 
   <p>The most famous story involving mediation, of course is that of &nbsp;the Buddha, meditating under a Bodhi Tree in 500 BC. Thereafter, in the 8<sup>th</sup> century a Japanese monk called Dosho was taught the art of Zen during a visit to China. Upon his return to Japan, Dosho opened up the first ever meditation hall and wrote down an instruction book on sitting meditation called ‚ÄúZazen‚Äù. </p> 
   <p>Meditation didn‚Äôt gain a following in the West until the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century. In the 1960s and 70s academicians and researchers became interested in meditation and started to scientifically study its effects. Dr. Herbert Benson of Harvard University was a pioneer in this initiative. Dr. Benson conducted a series of studies at Harvard in the 70s that proved the many benefits of meditation. He then went on to publish many articles on his findings and later wrote a book called <em>The Relaxation Response. </em>This book effectively explains how meditation acts as an antidote to stress. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-is-chronic-stress-and-how-does-it-affect-the-body""><strong>What Is Chronic Stress and How Does It Affect The Body?</strong></h2> 
   <p>To understand why meditation is important, we must first understand what stress is and what it does to the human body. Stress is a physical response we have under a myriad of conditions, and it is in fact part of our survival instincts. When a person is stressed, their mind goes into ‚Äúthe fight or flight‚Äù response. In this state, a person‚Äôs blood pressure will elevate and their consumption of oxygen will increase along with their breathing and heart rate. If you only feel stressed every once in a while, then this won‚Äôt be a problem for you. Yet if you‚Äôre like me and you get immensely stressed at the slightest thing, like an appointment you have to get to, a call you have to make or a deadline you have to meet, then you‚Äôll be in a near-constant state of stress. This is called chronic stress. In this state, your blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen consumption will always be high. Consider the impact this can have on your body. </p> 
   <p>Speaking from experience and research, I can say with absolute certainty that chronic stress and anxiety do have detrimental impacts on your physical and mental health. These include, but are not limited to: tense muscles, migraines, elevated blood pressure, panic attacks, and depression. These can lead to heart attacks, hyperventilation, chest pains, and chronic exhaustion. During the worst of my anxiety attacks, I felt a number of these symptoms; I was unable to breath at a normal rate, my body and chest flushed, my heart was pounding in my throat, and I constantly felt on edge. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-as-an-antidote-to-stress""><strong>Meditation As An Antidote to Stress</strong></h2> 
   <p>As bad a situation as this was, I had no idea how to overcome it. Then, one day, I was at the campus library with a classmate. I was working on a paper that I needed to finish, but I was so stressed about meeting the deadline that I was practically shaking with panic and was unable to make any headway. I was barreling into a panic attack and I could feel it. </p> 
   <p>Fortunately, my friend, Ruth, could see that I wasn‚Äôt in a good place and offered for us to go get some tea. I tried to say something about my paper, but she would hear none of it. She dragged me to the library caf√©, sat me down with some herbal tea and asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you so stressed?‚Äù. I explained about my paper and the deadline. She listened patiently, asked me questions about how I was feeling and why and helped me to understand that I had plenty of time. As I began to calm down, take deeper breaths and feel my heart slowing down, she asked me if I had ever tried meditation. I‚Äôm sad to say that I reacted with some of the same cynicism and doubt I critisize other form when she mentioned meditation. </p> 
   <p>I knew meditation was a fad and I didn‚Äôt feel any intense opposition toward it, though I wasn‚Äôt necessarily convinced it would have any effect on me. Ruth shared with me some of her own struggles with anxiety and the relief and sense of calm she was able to get from meditating consistently. Although our daily routines are so busy and chaotic, with meditation programs that you can connect to on your smartphone, you can pause any time during the day and whether it‚Äôs for 5 minutes or 30 minutes, you can recenter and connect with that inner sense of calm. On Ruth‚Äôs suggestion, I started trying Meditopia‚Äôs app meditations; we made a deal that I would give it at least two weeks worth of my dedication and effort. That‚Äôs it‚Äìjust two weeks. If it helped, I‚Äôd keep going. If it didn‚Äôt, then I would drop it.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-feeling-like-you-can-t-do-it-until-you-can""><strong>Feeling Like You Can‚Äôt Do It ‚Äì Until You Can</strong></h2> 
   <p>I sat down with the app the next morning, figuring I‚Äôd get it over with as quickly as possible. The first few times I meditated, all I could feel was a swelling impatience. But determined to make it through two weeks, I breathed through it, focusing on the rise and fall of my chest, just as the woman in the app was saying.</p> 
   <p>I didn‚Äôt notice any immediate effects in the following days and was convinced that it wasn‚Äôt working. Then, after my fourth or fifth day, I was back at the library to finish another paper. The deadline was in two days and I could feel myself getting stressed. I then paused, and started doing the meditation breathing exercises as I was working on my paper, without even realizing it. As I did this, my breath caught in my throat. It suddenly occurred to me that I was much calmer as I worked on my project. So, I pulled out my phone, put on my headphones, picked a meditation on stress and gave myself a ten-minute break. It was amazing how much more relaxed my muscles were, how much calmer my heart was. It was even more amazing how much faster I was now working.</p> 
   <p>This was a little over a year ago. These days, I meditate regularly. I generally do so first-thing in the morning, though sometimes I feel the need to give myself a little break during the day. So, I pause my work, put on my headphones and give myself that pause. </p> 
   <p>I haven‚Äôt had a single panic attack since I started using Meditopia. Nor have I had any chest pains or migraines like I did before. Meditation has helped me to come a long way with regards to my mental and physical health. </p> 
   <p>It‚Äôs because of this incredibly transformative journey I‚Äôve had with meditation, that I get so frustrated and bothered when someone accuses me of doing this solely because it‚Äôs a trend. There may be some people out there who are trying it for this reason, yet to dismiss meditation as a ‚Äútrend‚Äù is to dismiss all of its benefits. What‚Äôs more, is that it can put someone off who really needs meditation in the same way I did. </p> 
   <p>Being able to share my story on this platform, I would welcome us to share more stories about how beneficial meditation has been for us in finally eradicating this stigma and judgement around meditation. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-is-mental-health-still-a-taboo""><strong>Is Mental Health Still a Taboo?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I‚Äôve been  for many years. Trust me, I know how bad it can feel, especially when you‚Äôre worried about talking to people about it. However, my life and my response to anxiety began changing after I started using Meditopia and looked at my mental well-being from a different angle.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">These days, whenever I turn on the tv or go online, I inevitably encounter a story circling around mental health. There‚Äôs a celebrity talking about her depression or an author discussing anxiety attacks. From Marian Keyes and Kristen Bell to Selena Gomez, everyone seems to be discussing these topics more openly. As someone who‚Äôs dealing with an anxiety disorder myself, seeing such stories gives me hope. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm not alone. It also makes me feel relatively normal, something I sorely need. Though it also makes me wonder; does the fact that more people are open about such issues mean that mental health is no longer taboo?</p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There was a time, not so long ago, when mental health problems were simply not discussed. They were deep dark secrets, private corners that no one could or should peer into or ask questions about. They were individual and family embarrassments; a source of shame. The fact that more people are discussing these things would indicate that things have changed. Yet based on my personal experience, I can say that while ‚Äòmental health‚Äô has become a new buzzword in pop culture and media, there is still much progress to be made in the stigmatizing and shaming around mental wellness. Part of this progress has included more discussions on the benefits of meditation and mindfulness, and it‚Äôs because of this that I‚Äôve been more hopeful every time I see  and mindfulness in the media.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-dispelling-negative-stigma-around-mental-health""><strong>Meditation: Dispelling negative stigma around mental health</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Because meditation deals directly with a person‚Äôs mental well-being, having it plastered all over media and seeing books and articles written about it, helps to bring mental health issues into the public eye. Having more and more people practice meditation with apps like  directly enables people to address mental health in both a public and private way. Again, as someone who is struggling to maintain mental wellness, this reinforces for me the knowledge that I‚Äôm not alone when I‚Äôm meditating to address my anxiety issues.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You may be wondering why this is so important. Well, barring a few close friends and family, not a lot of people in my life know that I take anxiety meds and go to therapy. Most of the people at my publishing house‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhere I work‚Ää‚Äî‚Äädon‚Äôt know this about me either. This isn‚Äôt because I‚Äôm embarrassed about seeking help. It‚Äôs because I‚Äôd rather not face the stigma some people are bound to show me. The judging looks, the quiet whispers that suddenly cut off when I walk into the room‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not saying that everyone reacts this way but having experienced this situation with some ‚Äúfriends‚Äù who saw me take my meds, I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm keen on going through it on a daily basis. Though as the concept of meditation becomes more mainstream, it makes it easier to discuss mental wellbeing in the public eye.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-the-stigma-that-people-face""><strong>The Stigma That People&nbsp;Face</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">You might be wondering what kind of stigma someone like me might face. A great example of how people with mental health issues might be stigmatized comes directly from my workplace. One of my managers often says that sharing mental problems with them is perfectly alright and that everybody should be comfortable with this. I eventually opened up to her, a little bit about my anxiety issues.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When I first told her, she was very receptive and told me to let her know if there was anything that she could do. I made the mistake of believing her and knocked on her door on a day where my anxiety had gotten so bad that it felt debilitating. When I explained the situation to her and , so I could take some time for myself to regroup, she did a complete 180. She started out by saying that of course my mental health was important but preceded to explain that my work was equally important. The way she was explaining my job to me, frankly made me feel like I was being chastised by a teacher for not doing my homework on time.&nbsp;</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">What‚Äôs worse, she proceeded to ask me how I expected to get ahead in this business if I intended to take a personal day for ‚Äòevery little thing‚Äô. You can imagine how discouraged and even more triggered this made me feel. I felt this heavy weight on my chest, this nausea in my stomach, and the sensation of not being able to get enough air no matter how deeply I tried to breathe in. For those of you who struggle with paralyzing anxiety, you know that we are already incredible hard on ourselves (hence the anxiety). So to get this response from my superior almost brought me to my knees in desperation. It was as if the only thing that mattered was the competitive work environment I had to excel in, just to be ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù, even if that meant compromising my mental health and well-being. This incident proves that there are still barriers we need to get through to make mental wellbeing a topic that can be discussed thoughtfully and openly. </p> 
   <blockquote class=""wp-block-quote""> 
    <p> 41% of the global population suffers from depression and of that cohort, 15% suffer from an anxiety disorder. </p> 
   </blockquote> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The situation is a bad one for people with anxiety like me. On the one hand, you strive for your own health and well-being and try to find supportive individuals to surround you on your journey. On the other, you feel cut off from others for fear of being judged and stigmatized. This is why the new stories I mentioned go some way in cheering me up. They also peek my curiosity. Clearly there are people out there who experience the same things that I do. How many of them are out there? Am I part of a multitude or am I an anomaly?</p>

   <h2 id=""h-why-mental-health-is-the-skeleton-in-the-closet""><strong>Why Mental Health Is ‚ÄúThe Skeleton in the&nbsp;Closet‚Äù</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I think the problem comes partly from the fact that we view people focusing on their mental well-being, as anomalies when in fact everyone should do so regularly. Everybody falls and scrapes their knees sometimes or catches a cold. Likewise, everybody feels anxious sometimes, can have anxiety attacks or get depressed. In fact, 41% of the global population suffers from depression and of that cohort, 15% suffer from an anxiety disorder.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The problem is that we don‚Äôt acknowledge this. Instead we treat mental health problems as contagious diseases that we either have or don‚Äôt. We view them as weaknesses and sources of embarrassment. When we feel anxious about something, instead of talking about it, we suppress or avoid it. According to a study done by the Mental Health Charity MIND only 31% of men discuss their worries with friends and family. You‚Äôd think that maybe women would be better in this area but that‚Äôs not the case. It turns out, only 54% of women talk about their worries and sources of anxiety with their loved ones.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It would be easy to say that we shouldn‚Äôt being stigmatized or judged. It would be easy to say we should own what we‚Äôre feeling and speak our truth, unafraid and unashamed. But, as we know very well, saying something and doing it are two completely different things. I would know. I started seeking out help for my anxiety about 3 years ago. It took me just over a year to be able to open up to the people closest to me about this and it‚Äôs probably going to take even longer until I can live up to my words and be courageous enough to be open about it with everyone. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-meditation-helped-with-my-anxiety""><strong>How Meditation Helped with My&nbsp;Anxiety</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In my journey toward coping with my anxiety and maintaining my mental wellness, meditation has been a key practice for me. I initially started using Meditopia as a way of learning techniques to manage my anxiety, but what I realized was that Meditopia also connected me to a larger community dealing with the same issues. In being exposed to all of these people from around the world, managing the same feelings, and emotions I was, I felt my shame and dissolving away, day by day. When you use apps like Meditopia, you feel like there‚Äôs community with you during your practice. You see thousands of people are meditating for many different reasons, yet all for one purpose; to improve and maintain their mental well-being. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Specifically the meditations that helped me with my anxiety were the series on acceptance, anxiety and being present. While completing these daily meditations, I was constantly reminded that what I was going through was not something to be ashamed or embarrassed over. This reassurance helped me become more courageous in admitting to myself and others that I needed support in this journey. It helped me push aside any negative experiences I had when opening up, like with my employer, and continue trying to push myself to talk to my loved ones and close friends about what I was experiencing. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, I still haven‚Äôt been as open and candid with everyone in my life as I would have liked to be, but I‚Äôm getting there. I‚Äôm taking steps in this direction and I hope for this article to be one of them. I also hope this will help someone out there like me to understand that they‚Äôre not alone and that they can reach out for support. Additionally, I‚Äôd like to offer some suggestions to those of you who are trying to cope with anxiety, depression, and chronic stress. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-seeking-professional-help""><strong>Seeking Professional Help</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">If you have a health issue, you wouldn‚Äôt just ignore it and continue on with your life as you continually felt worse and worse. Most of us would try to see a doctor to determine a diagnosis and treatment plan. Likewise, many of us take consistent measures to maintain our health and avoid illness. We eat healthy food, exercise, practice good hygiene, get annual check-ups and take little steps to take care of our bodies. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Therapy works the same way. There‚Äôs nothing shameful about seeking out professional help for a mental health issue or for even maintaining and improving your mental wellness. Whether you‚Äôre trying to maintain a healthier mental balance in your life or need help and guidance in coping, therapists are trained and knowledgeable in giving you tools and techniques to do this. It could be anything; , depression, eating disorders‚Ä¶ What matters is that you address the issue with the support and guidance of someone who knows the way out of the woods.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-writing""><strong>Writing</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One of the most common tools therapists use are journals or logs. Writing in journals, particularly when you‚Äôre hit with an overwhelming emotion will help you to slow things down. It‚Äôll give you a moment to look at what‚Äôs upsetting you from afar, gain the distance you need, as well as an.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation""><strong>Meditation</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">While journal writing may not be the most expensive habit, going to therapy certainly can be. Of course, we should seek professional help when we can. Though if we aren‚Äôt able to at that time, we can always try to find alternative ways. I started meditating using Meditopia when I was still on the ropes about going to a therapist. This helped me in two ways. First, the breathing exercises and the focus that meditation required  my drumming heart and erratic breathing whenever I felt my anxiety mount. Second, the guided meditations showed me how I could and truly come to understand them. This enabled me to see that the reason I wasn‚Äôt going to therapy wasn‚Äôt because I thought ‚ÄúI can handle this myself‚Äù. It was because I was afraid. Understanding that fear was the first step towards overcoming it. It inevitably proved the first step towards getting better.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I know that‚Äôs saying a lot, having just gone over how difficult it is to open up to people about mental health issues. Though if we don‚Äôt talk to the people that are closest to us about the things that we‚Äôre going through‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääour fears, worries, the things that upset us or hurt us, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen we‚Äôll end up bottling them up. The worries that build up inside us will have nowhere to go and will naturally contribute to whatever mental illness we‚Äôre experiencing. If you have an anxiety disorder, like me, you‚Äôll only get more and more anxious until you have a full-on . If you‚Äôre depressed, you might find yourself being cut off more and more from the people you love, until you feel like you‚Äôre utterly and completely isolated.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The fact of the matter is, mental health issues can be scary‚Äîterrifying even. Which is why going through them alone is one of the worst things we can do for ourselves. It‚Äôs important to actively get the support, help and guidance we need at times. It‚Äôs even more important to remind ourselves that we are not alone, . This is why, while mental health may not be as taboo as it used to be, it needs to be pulled into the light more and more, until talking about it is as common as talking about staying home with a headache or catching a cold. Until we no longer feel that we are alone.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The relationships we have with our loved ones determine so many other aspects of our lives. In cultures across the world, the bonds between family members, friends, and the community at large are regarded as one of the most valuable parts of an individual‚Äôs life. Nourishing and fostering those relationships is seen as an essential part of living a fulfilling, happy and full life. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One relationship, in particular, is especially significant in impacting the long-term state of our overall peace of mind and ‚Äîthat is, with our romantic partner. Just think of a time when you and your partner were struggling with each other. It probably consumed so much of your energy and left you feeling exhausted, sad and hurt. This is a feeling so many of us are familiar with. This person whom you care about so much can oftentimes feel like a distant enemy, someone you don‚Äôt recognize, who has no regard for you or your feelings. During these periods, the internal turmoil within us can cause us to literally feel sick. We feel distracted, our emotions are intense, and we lack clarity. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so important to take the time to consider how we can contribute to creating a healthy, loving, kind, and mutually respectful dynamic with our partners. It may seem like a lot of time and effort to put in on a consistent basis, but it‚Äôs certainly less effort and pain than repairing a broken, toxic relationship. </p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here, we‚Äôll discuss three ways you can be more mindful, present and active in fostering a loving, tender, and fulfilling relationship with your partner. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before we start though, let‚Äôs remind ourselves of the definition of gratitude.  the quality of being thankful, kind and ready to show appreciation to another person. So, how do we show this kindness and appreciation to our partner? </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-practicing-gratitude-with-clarity""><strong>Practicing Gratitude With Clarity</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In Bren√© Brown‚Äôs book , one point stood out to me as being essential to starting and maintaining a relationship based on trust, respect, and accountability. In this book, Brown stated, ‚ÄúClear is kind. Unclear is unkind.‚Äù She went on to explain how being clear about our wants, expectations, goals, future desires, and feelings, whether it be with a friend, family member or romantic partner, is the kindest and most respectful thing you could do for them. Contrary to this, hiding our expectations, not clearly expressing what we want or need, or what we‚Äôre feeling is unkind to the person we‚Äôre interacting with. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Let‚Äôs consider how this plays out in our romantic relationships. Think of when you first meet someone that you‚Äôre interested in romantically. You have no idea what their expectations are, or what their plans and thoughts are about you. You don‚Äôt know about their past romantic experiences, what they regard as , or what values and traits they want in their potential partner. You don‚Äôt know if they dream of living on a yacht, or in a small shack in the mountains; you don‚Äôt know if they don‚Äôt want children or want 10. In spite of all of these question marks, we don‚Äôt often ask these questions. We fear it might come off as desperate, urgent, or odd; we don‚Äôt want to scare the other person off. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Weeks and then months go by and you‚Äôre still not quite sure what their expectations are for their life and for you. You feel anxiety, , and exasperation trying to decipher your partner‚Äôs actions and words, hoping the assumptions and stories you‚Äôve devised are accurate. This is simply exhausting and a frustrating waste of energy. <br></p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <div class=""wp-block-image""> 
    <figure class=""aligncenter size-large"">  
    </figure> 
   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Likewise in long-term relationships, we may still lack clarity on the wants and . Imagine marrying someone without discussing what kind of life you want to lead with them by your side. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">All of this spent energy wondering, stressing, ruminating on unanswered questions, this is precisely why being unclear is unkind. This applies to both you and your partner. Neither of you can read the other‚Äôs mind or understand your dreams, goals, worries, and plans without you clearly communicating them. It‚Äôs a kindness to share with your partner your expectations, wants, goals, and needs. In fact, you may want to even over-share. What I mean by that is discussing even the most minute details of what you want in your life. This could include how you divide labor in the house, how you will manage your money, separately or joint, what professional goals you have in the future, if you expect your partner to be the ‚Äòbreadwinner‚Äô, or if you want to live in a city or rural town. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now, just because you‚Äôre clear, doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll get everything you want. Far from it, it will take a great deal of compromise and discussion to agree on a life you both feel good about. Though by being clear with your partner and inviting them to do the same, you both will have a better understanding of the kind of life you can create together and for each other. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-practicing-gratitude-by-knowing-your-partner-s-love-languages""><strong>Practicing Gratitude by Knowing Your Partner‚Äôs Love Languages </strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another approach to expressing your love and gratitude to your partner is through what Dr. Gary Chapman calls in his book  In this book series, Chapman, an author, speaker and counselor on relationships, reminds us that being in a relationship where unconditional love, respect and consideration thrives, requires us to express our love in a way that is best received by our partner. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">He goes on to discuss that each of us has a preference for how we receive love, these being: gifts, quality time, words of affirmation, acts of service, and physical touch. When you know your partner‚Äôs preference and express your love in that specific way, your partner is more likely to notice and understand the depth of your feelings and consideration for them. Chapman calls this ‚Äòfilling up your love tank‚Äô. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Likewise, if you are showing your love in a way that your partner doesn‚Äôt perceive as love, you risk your partner not feeling cared about, fulfilled or appreciated, leaving them with an ‚Äòempty love tank‚Äô. If you and your partner are curious about each other‚Äôs respective love language, you can complete  to help you determine how you best receive love. Meditation is also another way of identifying the things your partner does which mean the most to you. Through visualization exercises, you‚Äôll be able to understand all of the little actions your partner takes that perhaps reflect their own love language or fulfill yours. <br></p>

   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here‚Äôs an example that you can consider. Let‚Äôs say my primary love languages turned out to be acts of service and quality time and my partner‚Äôs were gifts and words of affirmation. If I try to show my love for him by helping him with a chore or work project, cleaning his car, or having a nice picnic together, sure, he might enjoy those things, but it might not occur to him that I‚Äôm doing those things to show my love. On the other hand, if I were aware of his love languages and surprised him with a meaningful gift every now and then, or consistently let him know my feelings for him and what I appreciate about him? His love tank would be overflowing! <br></p>

     <p><strong>Gratitude requires practice, but the health of your relationship is worth it. </strong></p> 
    </blockquote> 
   </figure> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> often times means putting your preferences aside and acknowledging that making your partner happy and &nbsp;helping them feel loved, safe, appreciated, and respected isn‚Äôt about you and how you receive love. So rather than asking what you can get out of being with your partner, shift your mindset to how you can contribute positively to their life. You can even start by asking them once a week, ‚Äúhow can I make your life better or easier this week?‚Äù and then do that one habit. Once you begin to put the effort toward learning and executing your partner‚Äôs love language, you‚Äôll rekindle a deeper well of love and connection that you could have ever expected. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-being-present-accepting-your-partner""><strong>Being Present &amp; Accepting Your Partner </strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sometimes the answers to our biggest relationship issues are right in front of our eyes. Think about it, perhaps your partner has a habit of meeting with their friends a few times a month or getting little  for their loved ones. By being present and observing the daily actions of our partner, we can understand so much about what they consider to be expressions of love. Additionally, the more present we are when we‚Äôre with our partner, the more we will begin to acknowledge all of the little actions they take to make our lives and the lives of others better and easier. Consequently, the more we open our eyes to these attributes, the more our gratitude and appreciation for our partners will grow, and with that, our willingness to do our part in showing our love for them. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Another component that is very easy to forget with our partners is accepting them, just as they are at this moment. Oftentimes, we resist and fight against certain characteristics and habits of our partner because we have an expectation of how they should be or what we want them to be. This, in direct contrast to the aforementioned lessons around clarity and love languages, creates an ongoing tension between our partner and ourselves. Acceptance requires us to willingly receive and welcome the experiences, characteristics, memories, attributes, and‚Äîmost importantly‚Äîflaws of our partner. Just as you have a unique personality made up of your memories and experiences, so does your partner. Just as there are certain habits and characteristics about your partner you wish were different, so are there habits of yours they wish would change. And just as you have evolved and changed over time, so will your partner. The ultimate demonstration of gratitude and love is acceptance, for both you and your partner. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Admittedly, it can be a daily struggle not to lunge forward, trying to correct and ‚Äútrain‚Äù our partners. Trust me, as a self-proclaimed control freak, there have been many times when I have to bite my tongue before criticizing the way my partner does something. Yet when I pause and look at the bigger picture, the value, positive influence, and  offers far outweigh any of these flaws. The Meditopia meditations on relationships helped me, in fact, to quiet those voices that were critical of my partner. Through these seven days I learned how to draw my attention away from resisting what I wanted to change about my partner‚Äôs habits, to focusing on the immense joy, support, and love I feel with him. As I said, it‚Äôs not an overnight cure, but it‚Äôs helped me take steps toward retraining my mind how to approach our relationship. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-gratitude-requires-practice-but-the-health-of-your-relationship-is-worth-it""><strong>Gratitude requires practice, but the health of your relationship is worth it. </strong><br></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We‚Äôve discussed some helpful approaches to reviving or maintaining a mutually fulfilling dynamic with your partner, but none of these are helpful with time and practice. Just as we take small steps everyday toward maintaining our health, appearance, and professional life, we must also recognize that our relationship, a part of our life that has an enormous impact on all other aspects of our lives, requires its due attention and consideration. It doesn‚Äôt have to mean a sudden upheaval of your daily schedule. The purpose of the Relationship Meditation series is to give you and your partner a short period of time, no longer than twenty minutes, to pause, take a pulse check on the condition of your relationship, and consider ways of nourishing the mutual love, respect, and support you both have for each other. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As always, we‚Äôd love to hear your comments and feedback below. What helps you and your partner maintain a healthy dynamic? Do you and your partner have different love languages? What‚Äôs one thing you can do, starting today, to make your partner‚Äôs life easier and better?<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Remembering to feel grateful for the things we have is becoming increasingly difficult amidst the fast-paced lives we lead‚Ä¶ We know , we recognize that it‚Äôs a positive feeling to have, but do we really feel its presence on a daily basis? Do we really remember to be thankful for the little things we accomplish while running our daily errands? Sometimes we may feel like gratitude is a feeling that should just emerge on its own, organically, and yet the fact is that gratitude is a habit, a practice we must develop in order to feel on a daily basis.</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Appreciation, gratitude, ‚Ä¶ It doesn‚Äôt matter what we call it; what matters is focusing on the meaning behind the words.

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In the past few years, gratitude has become a focal point of . This is largely thanks to research that has been done around this feeling. As scientists put it, gratitude is one of the main building blocks toward having a healthy mental and physical state of being. The more natural and consistent we become in feeling and expressing gratitude for any of the many parts of our lives, the more we benefit physically, mentally and emotionally from that habit. On the whole, practicing gratitude makes us feel more positive and patient and less selfish and frustrated. As we‚Äôve discussed in our previous posts, gratitude provides us with physical comfort, enables us to form healthier, more positive relationships and increases our happiness and sense of optimism. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Gratitude is an instinct that exists in all of us, but like most our instincts it needs to be given proper attention so that it may develop. We tend to focus so much on negative situations and aspects of our lives that complaining is our first instinct, rather than giving thanks. Even when we‚Äôre wishing and hoping for something, when we finally receive it, we don‚Äôt often feel that elation and appreciation that we may have expected to feel. That is to say, we don‚Äôt give thanks for achieving or obtaining what we want, at least not to the same degree that we yearned for it. <br></p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Instead, we tend to focus on all of the things that went wrong while we were getting what we wanted. The plane was delayed on our trip to Italy, the renovations took one week longer than we expected for our new kitchen, we have to work long nights and sometimes over the weekend to get that promotion‚Äîyou get the idea. We‚Äôve all experienced those situations and we‚Äôve all spent many hours of our lives recounting the struggles we faced to finally get what we wanted. &nbsp;<br></p>

In fact, much of what makes up gratitude is knowing, being aware and being appreciative. To be able to express gratitude, we need to be aware of what we have to be grateful for.

Taking a deep, refreshing breath in, smelling the scent of a ripe fruit, watching the sunset, tasting your coffee, or feeling the purr of a cat by your side‚Ä¶.These are just some small examples of things we encounter every day and can be grateful for. Yet how how can we be thankful for those small things if we don‚Äôt notice them? We can‚Äôt. Only by living in the moment, can you begin noticing these small blessings and begin to appreciate them on a consistent basis. When we start to go through our day more mindfully, letting our senses and emotions lead the way, we‚Äôll start to notice the joy we feel in putting on a comfortable sweater, hearing your child‚Äôs laugh, picking out food at the market, or even fixing something in your house. All these and more can evoke our instinct for gratitude, if we‚Äôre ready to let it. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">There are some simple exercises that you can start today to help you wake up those gratitude muscles. Just like anything you want to learn, it requires commitment and consistency. Here are five ways you can pick and choose from to invite more gratitude into your daily life:</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-1-get-a-notebook-that-will-be-dedicated-specifically-to-things-and-people-you-re-grateful-for""><strong>1.Get a notebook that will be dedicated specifically to things and people you‚Äôre grateful for</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Each page can cover a period of 3 or 5 years, depending on how big a notebook you‚Äôve chosen. Then every night or every morning, write down 3 things, people, or situations you‚Äôre grateful for. Over time this will becoming increasingly easier and there will be days when you flip back through the pages and are reminded of all of the pleasant things have occured over that time period.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-2-create-a-gratitude-jar""><strong>2.Create a Gratitude Jar</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It doesn‚Äôt matter what shape it is but make it a big one, so that it will last a long time. Write one thing you‚Äôre grateful for every day on a small piece of paper and throw it into the jar. Pick a random one out whenever you‚Äôre having a difficult day and read it to remind yourself of the beauty in life.</p>

   <h3 id=""h-3-start-your-day-by-giving-thanks""><strong>3.Start your day by giving thanks.</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Stay in bed just a little while longer and think of whatever it is you‚Äôre grateful for. Maybe it‚Äôs your sweetheart, lying next to you, maybe it‚Äôs the fact that you  and feel refreshed, or it could even be that you‚Äôre grateful simply because you woke up at all‚Ä¶</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-4-set-a-gratitude-alarm""><strong>4.Set a gratitude alarm</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Take advantage of the opportunities technology gives you and set an alarm that will actively remind you to give thanks at a specific point in the day. That way, you can start being more aware throughout the day, feel the force of your existence and express your gratitude for it. You can begin living your life more fully. If you have a tight schedule, you can set your alarm for different times throughout the day, to accommodate your needs, so long as you take the time to notice the beauty around you.</p> 
   <h3 id=""h-5-pick-an-object-that-reminds-you-of-gratitude""><strong>5.Pick an object that reminds you of gratitude</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">This could be something like a necklace or a small object you can keep in your wallet. It can be something that‚Äôs a color you like or has a pattern you find beautiful. Whatever you choose, make it something you enjoy looking at, preferably something you‚Äôve recently acquired. Let it be something that can become one with its purpose, that can remind you to give thanks every time you look at it.</p>

What Is Gratitude & Why Do I Need It? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me?‚Äù we sometimes find ourselves wondering. ‚ÄúWhat did I do to deserve this?‚Äù The simple fact about life is that it‚Äôs not always apparent why something is happening a certain way. Life isn‚Äôt always a walk in the park. It‚Äôs more like a roller coaster ride: you have your ups and downs. Sometimes, you‚Äôre ready to get off and be on solid ground, but the ride just keeps on going, throwing you from side to side. Sometimes it can feel like your troubles just won‚Äôt let up and like the walls are caving in ‚Äî even if they aren‚Äôt. Our struggles do not make up the whole of our lives, although it can be hard to realize that when we‚Äôre in the middle of them. Recognizing this requires a skill that we‚Äôre quick to forget: gratitude.</p> 
   <h2><strong>What Is Gratitude?</strong></h2> 
   <p>The Yale Center of Emotional Intelligence defines gratitude as  Put simply, gratitude is noticing the good things that happen to us, the good things others do for us or just noticing the pleasant things that we come across throughout the day. This is why we can practice gratitude at any time we choose. We can look at someone we love and think of how grateful we are to have them in our lives. We can catch a glimpse of the wide-open sky and be grateful that we can experience its momentary beauty. We can take a sip of tea and savor the taste. We can take a deep breath and give thanks for being healthy. In all of these actions of gratitude, we take a moment to appreciate something we generally take for granted.<br></p> 
   <p>The curious thing about gratitude is that we can practice it even when we‚Äôre going through something difficult. Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôve run into unexpected financial troubles and we‚Äôre feeling very worried and unsettled about the future. We might try to offset this stress by making plans and calculations around our finances. We may be completely consumed by our worries and need to control that we completely forget about the moment we‚Äôre in. <br></p> 
   <p>Pause. Take a deep breath. Where are you right now? Do you have a roof over your head? Are you in a safe place? Do you have people that love you and support you? Are the people you love safe and well? So much of the pain and frustration we feel from the circumstances we experience stems from how we perceive and react to those circumstances. By remembering to express gratitude in the midst of these situations, we can refocus our attention and adjust our perspective. We can make ourselves see that things aren‚Äôt as bleak as we thought. That‚Äôs not to say that we should ignore the situation we‚Äôre in. We simply adjust our outlook on it.<br></p>

   <h2><strong>How Gratitude Benefits Your Health</strong></h2> 
   <p>Practicing gratitude on a consistent basis is proven to have positive impacts on our overall health. When we practice gratitude, we directly tap into positive emotions, such as wonder, joy and peace of mind. These emotions soothe and reduce the intensity of negative emotions such as jealousy, bitterness, or envy. So, the more we practice gratitude, the less we ask questions like ‚ÄúWhy is this happening to me?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I have this or that?‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI deserve that more than them.‚Äù Such questions and comments that creep into our minds only pull us further away from living a life with integrity and which fosters peace of mind and fulfillment.<br></p> 
   <p>Focusing our attention more on the positive aspects of every situation, and shifting it slowly away from those negative comments, judgements and questions helps us decrease our risk of depression and anxiety. Emotions like joy, love and enthusiasm have positive effects in our bodies. Therefore by actively trying to focus on the experiences and aspects of our lives that make us feel those emotions, we enjoy those health benefits. We become more resilient and are better able to manage our stress, anxiety, and depression, all of which can weaken our immune systems of a long period of time. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>How Can I Practice Gratitude?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Gratitude isn‚Äôt a randomly occurring emotion. It‚Äôs something we must actually seek out on a daily basis and train like a muscle. At first it may seem forced and a bit unnatural, yet as you continue to focus on what you have to be grateful for, it becomes easier and easier, day by day. <br></p> 
   <p>There are a couple of ways we can practice gratitude regularly. One way is through practicing mindfulness meditation or yoga. During such exercises, we are forced to actively pay attention to our sensations, feelings, thoughts, and surroundings. We are guided toward thoughts of the people and things we have in our lives; we come to notice the value all of these contribute to our everyday lives. During meditations, these emotions and thoughts become amplified and we learn how to tap into those emotions on our own throughout the rest of our day. It can be for as little as 5 minutes up to an hour or more; yet just by taking that time to pause and pay attention, we‚Äôre closer and closer to understanding the transformative impact of gratitude. <br></p> 
   <p>Meditations focused specifically on gratitude take this a step further. These meditations help us focus on the good things in our lives. They draw our attention to acts of kindness from our friends. They make us notice just how our family and loved ones support us. We begin to notice even the simplest and smallest of acts and gestures that have brought us joy and warmth in our lives. We may even feel prompted to give thanks for those acts, further strengthening our bonds among our loved ones. . <br></p> 
   <p>Expressing our gratitude is another excellent way of furthering the practice we‚Äôve cultivated in our meditations. What‚Äôs more, it lets our loved ones know that they are loved and valued. This fosters the connection between us and helps us create a feeling of safety, trust, and comradery among us. Think back: When was the last time a person in your life helped you in some way? When was the last time you expressed genuine gratitude to the people in your life, either for the things they did or simply for being there by your side? How would it feel to reach out to them, even over a message, and just tell them you‚Äôre grateful for them. <br></p> 
   <p>One of the last ways of practicing gratitude that we‚Äôll cover is through writing. Writing down the things that we‚Äôre grateful for is an excellent way of organizing our thoughts and seeing right there before you, everything that you feel thankful for. By writing it out, we can begin to make sense of what we‚Äôre thinking. What‚Äôs more is we can elaborate and reflect on our thoughts and perhaps even use them to create a new frame for whatever situation we‚Äôre in. It‚Äôs also a very interesting exercise to look months or even years back into your journals and see what and how you were thinking at the time. <br></p>

Mindfulness Makes for More Mindful Sex üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Think of the last time you slept with your partner. Try to remember the experience in your mind at that moment, rather than your physical movements. Where was your mind as you looked into your partner‚Äôs eyes? You may have been thinking about a lot of things at that moment; whether or not you‚Äôre going to orgasm, whether your partner notices you‚Äôve gained weight, whether you‚Äôre able to satisfy them, the &nbsp;mounting list of things you still need to get done today, a friend who‚Äôs having a problem in their life or if your kid in the next room can hear you or not‚Ä¶ This list will only keep growing‚Äîif you let it. <br></p> 
   <p>Mindful awareness helps us focus on whatever we‚Äôre doing in that moment; it can therefore be a guide for you while you‚Äôre having sex, just as it can while you‚Äôre eating or taking a walk. Mindful sex is a topic that is discussed more and more these days as it has been identified as an essential way of overcoming problems with intimacy and enjoyment during sex. Even if you don‚Äôt feel that you have experienced any issues in your relationship until now, mindful sex is an effective way of savouring and enjoying your sex life even more. Being mindful while having sex can help you more fully experience your pleasure, your partner, and all of the emotions, sensations and thoughts that come with this experience.<br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-mindful-awareness-and-sex""><strong>Mindful Awareness and Sex</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>To contribute to this conversation, we‚Äôve reached out to Sexologist  and Sexual Issues Activist . Kumru describes mindful sex as ‚Äúany sexual activity we take part in with our entire minds, hearts and bodies‚Ä¶‚Äù. Graham, a meditation teacher, sex, relationship and spirituality guide for individuals and couples, and author of&nbsp;<em></em> defined it similarly: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to choose one outlook over the other. Just do what is real for you.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <p>Our minds can tend to get in between us and our partners when we‚Äôre having a sexual experience, especially if we‚Äôre in the later stages of a relationship. The overwhelming excitement and adrenaline we feel in the first few months of our relationship gives way to certain responsibilities. This doesn‚Äôt mean that our love or desire ends, it simply means that our minds begin prioritizing other things over sex. Graham mentioned that the couples that come to her for help are generally in long-term, committed relationships. She stressed that hot passion generally gives way to a calmer loyalty and that this transition is, in fact, rooted in biology: ‚ÄúMindful sex can be a great help to us in this stage. It can help you to figure out what‚Äôs pleasurable for you, as well as discover new things. Besides, your sexuality and your sexual relationship with your partner always needs attention, just like a friend would. Think of how your relationship with a good friend would deteriorate if you never communicated.‚Äù Rayka stresses something similar about long term relationships and mindful sex: ‚ÄúThe mind doesn‚Äôt really want some<em>one</em> new, it just wants something new.‚Äù<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-tips-for-more-mindful-sex""><strong>Tips for More Mindful Sex</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>During our interview, we also asked Rayka for tips on having more mindful sex and she offered a couple of suggestions: ‚ÄúI think one of the most effective things is to take your time. Everything else in our lives are already so fast-paced. Another point is not to consider sex or sexual expression solely as sexual intercourse. Nudity, kissing, embracing, standing together, looking at each other, dancing, watching something erotic‚Ä¶ All of these are sexual activities and ways in which we can express our sexuality. When we reduce sexual activity to just sexual intercourse we reduce it to two goals; penetration and ejaculation . We are more likely to be present and therefore enjoy sex if we are not racing towards a specific goal. &nbsp;Not being goal-oriented also prevents us from rushing because we have nowhere to, just some way to be. <br></p> 
   <p>Which brings me to a third key factor: touch. What popular media presents to us as ‚Äúforeplay‚Äù once again makes us believe that the overall goal of sex is intercourse. Yet if we were to stay in the moment with each other and enjoy the sensations that come simply from touch, we would find the same, if not more, pleasurable stimulation than from physical unity. To add to this, Graham says that an individual must first be in contact with themselves and get to know their own body intimately, before being able to form more of an awareness with their partner during sex. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-make-peace-with-yourself-in-the-mirror""><strong>Make Peace With Yourself in the Mirror</strong></h2> 
   <p>We also invited relationship mentors and influencers, , to our conversation around mindful sex. During our interview with them, the couple stressed the importance of being yourself, independent of all conditions and creating a space where you value yourself. Danny and Mara affirmed that the first step we should take in nourishing intimacy and comfort with our partners is to begin connecting with ourselves. Accepting yourself without the need for validation begins to invite self-love and a language of love into our sex life. Making peace with what we see when we look in the mirror is the key to a truly great sexual experience. <br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-how-does-meditation-affect-sex""><strong>How Does Meditation Affect Sex?</strong> <br></h2> 
   <p>A regular, intentional awareness practice will create positive changes in all areas of our lives, including our sexual experiences. As Sexologist Kumru puts it, ‚ÄúEverything that happens in a person‚Äôs life is connected. If you can‚Äôt be present when you‚Äôre at work and can‚Äôt concentrate, then odds are you‚Äôll be thinking of work when you‚Äôre at home with your partner. The mind is a greedy thing; it jumps from one thing to the next and is constantly under bombardment, and &nbsp;thanks to technology, even when we‚Äôre in bed, we can remain distracted.‚Äù Awareness comes automatically with meditation, so do lower stress levels, a higher and more positive perception of the body, and higher levels of concentration, all of which positively impact our sexual experiences. Kumru adds that research consistently shows that when people are asked about their best sexual experiences, they talk about times when they were able to be in the moment with their partners.<br></p> 
   <p>Kumru also talks about something that could change the way we think about our relationships as well: ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that our relationships become boring in time, it‚Äôs that there‚Äôs this feeling that our sexual lives will always remain the same and as exciting , even as our lives are rapidly changing.‚Äù Graham added to this saying that, ‚Äúmindfulness practices give us the gift of revealing what we‚Äôre feeling and demanding. This attitude invites sincerity, the ability to empathize with our partner, which enables us to create memories will remember with a smile on our face.‚Äù <br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-give-your-sexuality-the-attention-it-deserves""><strong>Give Your Sexuality the Attention It Deserves</strong></h2> 
   <p>We‚Äôre leaving you with the websites of the people that we‚Äôve spoken with about sexuality, which is a large part of our lives and composes the dynamic of our relationships, so that you can reap the benefit of their knowledge. Connect with your individuality with mindfulness.<br></p>

Why Self-Love Starts with Self-Compassion üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <h2 id=""h-compassion-one-of-our-oldest-feelings""><strong>Compassion: One of Our Oldest Feelings</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>The word compassion evokes a warmth and softness in us when we hear it. When we think about the word compassion, we may think of helping someone in need, comforting a loved one, or feeling a sense of sadness and pain in witnessing another person experiencing misfortune. Compassion is an incredibly powerful sentiment that can influence us to take action, connect with others and see in others reflections of ourselves. <br></p> 
   <p>Despite our general awareness that compassion is a vital part of connection, comradery and belonging, we often get swept up in feelings of stress, anger, worry, and anxiety. These emotions have a way of leading us to only focus on our own lives, and being less inclined to reach out to others. <br></p> 
   <p>And yet, everything that brings joy, connection, love, and belonging into our lives starts with love and one of the key ingredients to love is not only compassion for others, but compassion for ourselves. It‚Äôs often said that we cannot give others what we ourselves do not have. Thus, we cannot love fully or have compassion for others fully without first filling our cup with self-love and self-compassion. When you try to visualize compassion, you may think of someone‚Äôs hand reaching out to hold yours and the comfort, assurance and consolation that can bring you. Just as we can feel the calming impact of someone else treating us with compassion, we must also learn to treat ourselves with compassion. Again, only through self-compassion can we learn to love ourselves and thus love others. Before talking more about this, though, let‚Äôs get a better handle on what self-compassion is. <br></p>

   <h2 id=""h-what-is-self-compassion""><strong>What is self-compassion?</strong> </h2> 
   <p>Self-compassion is kindly holding out a hand to ourselves when we need it the most. It‚Äôs being kind and patient with yourself regardless of what you‚Äôre experiencing. Self-compassion means that we lovingly accept ourselves as we are now, independent of the past or the future. It‚Äôs the most sincere and genuine form of love, always helping us to be our best selves not only for own our fulfillment but for the benefits of others. Should we be experiencing challenges and emotional turmoil, self-compassion allows us to cope with any struggle in an assertive yet calm and peaceful manner. Self-compassion acts as a compass that guides us in creating healthy boundaries so that regardless of what we‚Äôre experiencing, we‚Äôre able to feel more certain about what is required of us and what is not. &nbsp;<br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-what-happens-when-we-approach-ourselves-with-self-compassion""><strong>What Happens When We Approach Ourselves with Self-Compassion?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Self-compassion is a practice that enables individuals to form a healthy, solid relationship with themselves. When we approach ourselves with the same consideration we would show to someone who was going through a difficult time, we are able to form a lasting friendship with ourselves. <br></p> 
   <p>One consideration to note with regards to ourselves, is that our ‚Äúself‚Äù is frequently caught between happiness, contentment and serenity and enduring disruptive and stressful situations. Fortunately, the more we‚Äôre able to practice self-compassion, the better we‚Äôll be able to cope with the negative emotions and situations we experience. When confronted with a challenging situation, rather than feeling destructive emotions such as shame, self-criticism and self-blame‚Äîemotions which do not help us resolve any issue‚Äîwe will be more inclined to acknowledge our mistakes or the mistakes of others in a more productive manner. Additionally, when we feel disappointment, sadness or anger as a reaction to the actions of others, self-compassion will protect us from acting outside of our integrity and help us to continue honoring ourselves and others. That‚Äôs not all though; &nbsp;self-compassion has an incredibly powerful impact on our Sympathetic Nervous System, affecting our overall health. <br></p>

   <p>When your mind senses a physical threat, it will automatically defer to the Sympathetic or Parasympathetic Nervous System. When this happens, the mind perceives emotional or spiritual problems as physical threats as well and, unable to cope with these problems, retreats into itself. As a result, we tend to isolate and doubt ourselves, thinking solely of our own welfare and needs. It‚Äôs like when Dostoyevski said: ‚ÄúWhining is nothing more than deepening an already bleeding wound.‚Äù That means that when we criticize or inflict shame and blame on ourselves, we‚Äôre actually hurting ourselves. And when we are hurt, it is much more difficult to apply love, compassion and understanding with others. As the popular saying goes, ‚ÄòHurt people, hurt people‚Äô. By showing ourselves compassion, we can be free of this torture we put ourselves through and foster an openness and willingness to be compassionate and loving with others. </p> 
   <h2 id=""h-self-compassion-as-a-tool-for-resilience-and-self-love""><strong>Self-Compassion as a Tool for Resilience and Self-Love</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>The more an individual practices self-compassion, nourishing peace of mind, patience, love, and kindness within themselves, the more those same sentiments will spill over into all of the other parts of their life. Instead of making decisions or behaving from a place of shame, self-criticism, fear, or anger, their lives will be guided by understanding, calmness, patience, and acceptance. <br></p> 
   <p>By practicing self-compassion, we begin to accept ourselves, just as we are right in the moment. As we change day by day, we continue to learn more about ourselves and accept our characteristics, values, habits, and thoughts, without judgement or pressure. That means that when we‚Äôre enduring pain and discomfort, we approach ourselves just as we would someone we love. Rather than using harsh, critical words with ourselves, we begin to be kinder and more understanding with ourselves. That doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt hold ourselves accountable; that‚Äôs an important distinction to make. Just because we are compassionate with ourselves and others does not mean we do not hold ourselves accountable and question our decisions and judgements.<br></p> 
   <p>What it does mean is that as we continue to approach ourselves with compassion, rather than our minds and bodies going into a flight-or-fight mode, seized by fear and powerful negative emotions, we will be able to assess and resolve the situation with a sense of calm and clarity. <br></p> 
   <p>The compassion we show to ourselves will eventually spread out throughout our environments. The way we approach the world will evolve as we practice and learn from compassion, eventually helping us to show more compassion and love to others as well. <br></p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-components-of-self-compassion""><strong>The Components of Self-Compassion</strong><br></h2> 
   <p>According to studies conducted by Dr. Kristin Neff, self-compassion is made up of 3 components: Being kind to yourself, knowing that everyone sometimes feels the same way we do and intentional awareness.<br></p> 
   <p>Being kind to yourself is the opposite of judging yourself. When things don‚Äôt go the way we want them to, the most common response we have is to blame and judge ourselves. Self-compassion reverses this tendency; instead it helps us to accept matters with understanding and tolerance, even when they don‚Äôt go our way. <br></p> 
   <p>Knowing that everyone in the world has shared the same pains we‚Äôre experiencing, often saves us from feeling alone and isolated. When we suffer, we have the tendency to wonder: ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù When we ask this question, ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù, we create the impression in our minds that everyone, apart from ourselves, leads problem-free lives, far from suffering, while we‚Äôre here stuck in a dark tunnel. By showing ourselves self-compassion, we internally remind ourselves that we‚Äôre not alone, that many other people go through these same emotions and situations, that there are so many other people who can and have felt this same pain. <br></p> 
   <p>Intentional awareness is being aware of what‚Äôs happening right now, paying full attention to it with no judgements whatsoever and accepting it open heartedly. Intentional awareness is a must in the path to self-compassion because we need to feel the pain we‚Äôre in. Being able to hold out a loving hand to our pain, after experiencing it is self-compassionate awareness. </p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-open-is-the-road-to-self-compassion""><strong>How Open Is the Road to Self-Compassion?</strong></h2> 
   <p>The fact that we‚Äôve encountered compassion and recorded it into our emotional intelligence enables us to create a new self formed by self-compassion. The universal desire of all beings, ‚Äúbeing happy, away from suffering, safe and at peace‚Äù opens up more room for self-compassion. Transforming the compassion inherent in every being into self-compassion and developing it is like developing a muscle. All it takes is a little work.</p>

   <p>Helen Keller once said, ‚ÄúI would rather walk with a friend in the dark than walk alone in the light,‚Äù. This statement echoes a sentiment many of us feel. We as human beings are social creatures. We crave deep, meaningful connections. Though oftentimes we feel like we‚Äôre unable to form bonds that go deep enough to be called true friendships. We end up having shallow conversations that don‚Äôt really scratch the surface. Or perhaps we don‚Äôt feel as though we‚Äôre an integral part of our friends‚Äô lives ‚Äì or that they‚Äôre an important part of ours. Sometimes we feel we can‚Äôt connect with the people around us at all. So, how can we overcome this? How can we form and cultivate friendships that will last us a lifetime?<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Why Do We Need Friends Anyways?</strong></h2> 
   <p>Scientists are baffled as to why human beings really need friends. All they know, for sure, is that we do. Over the years, numerous studies have found that having genuine friendships is very beneficial for our mental well-being. A recent Harvard study revealed that forming close friendships promotes brain health as we age. In the past, it‚Äôs been proven that friendship extends a person‚Äôs life expectancy and even lowers various health risks, like heart disease.</p> 
   <p>The reason having friends is so good for us is that they serve as pillars in our lives. Friends support us when we need it the most. A divorce, a loss, a failed exam, a demotion‚Ä¶ No matter what we‚Äôre going through, they will be by our side all the whole way through. We don‚Äôt know why we develop such behavioral patterns with our friends. Only that we do and that it is good for us. <br></p> 
   <h2><strong>How Is A Friendship Formed?</strong></h2> 
   <p>C.S. Lewis once described the moment we make a new friend, saying that, ‚ÄúFriendship is born at that moment when one person says to another: ‚ÄúWhat? You too? Thought I was the only one.‚Äù He could not have been more right. All relationships need a starting point, a common ground, so to speak. Having such a common ground is a great starting point to bond over. Though if we don‚Äôt build on them, if we don‚Äôt use the common ground we‚Äôre given, then we‚Äôll never be able to turn an acquaintance into an actual friendship. So, what do we need to do to turn this pivotal moment into an actual relationship? How do we turn a stranger we have something in common with, into a real friend. And perhaps most importantly, how do we become a real friend ourselves?<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Cultivating A Close Friendship</strong></h2> 
   <p>Relationships are complex. There is no ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù guide to navigate them, because every individual and every relationship is different. That being said, there are several factors that govern how friendships are formed. By meditating on these factors, we can better understand our friendships, our friends and ourselves. Only then can we begin to explore and finally resolve our perception of human connections.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Finding Common Ground</strong></h2> 
   <p>Finding common ground with those who we feel a connection with isn‚Äôt just a good starting point for friendship, it‚Äôs also a step that enables us to simultaneously learn more about them while also revealing more about ourselves. Most often we seek out similarities between us and the other person to begin building common ground. This could be anything. Attitude in life, values, interests, age, gender, socio-economic status, hobbies, experiences‚Ä¶ Uncovering these kinds of similarities help us better understand the people before us. We feel like we know part of them and feel the urge to know more. The similarities we discover and expand on make us more open to the differences between our friends and us. It gives us more reasons to explore them and thus understand our friend better and better as time goes on. The more open we are to this, the deeper our understanding will be. And the deeper our understanding, the better a friend we will become.<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>Self-Disclosure.</strong></h2> 
   <p>The basis of any healthy relationship is trust. Though trust doesn‚Äôt just happen overnight. As you very well know, trust takes time to develop. One of the best ways of building trust is not only showing someone consistently over time how you behave, make decisions and treat others, but by being vulnerable. If we want trusting relationships, we have to be willing to open up to the person before us. We have to be willing to share with them personal things that they would otherwise not know about us and in doing so risk being hurt. Our feelings, our worries and innermost thoughts, private memories like breakups or past mistakes. The more open we are, the more vulnerable we allow ourselves to become. By doing this we give our friend a clear message: ‚ÄúI trust you with this information about me. I trust you not to hurt me.‚Äù Now, that‚Äôs not to say that we should be vulnerable with just anyone. Choose wisely who gets to hear your stories, but know that by never trusting anyone with any personal information, you may indefinitely distance yourself from creating any genuine friendships. Yes, you risk being hurt should someone betray you, but the alternative is that you never feel able to truly rely or depend on anyone, a feeling which is isolating and detrimental to your physical and mental health. <br></p> 
   <p>Our willingness to be trusting and vulnerable prompts our friends to be so as well. In this way we share into the lives of our friends and earn their trust. If we have issues connecting to others and forming non-superficial relationships, trust and vulnerability are excellent factors to meditate on. How much do we really open up to our friends? How much of ourselves and our lives are we willing to share? How much do we share in the lives of our friends? If the answer to these questions is ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù, then it might be time to little by little push ourselves to share more.<br></p>

   <h2><strong>Reciprocity.</strong></h2> 
   <p>Reciprocity is a must in all healthy relationships. This is the act of sharing parts of yourself and life with your friend and having your friend do the same. It‚Äôs investing time in your friend, whether meeting up for a cup of coffee, or showing up to an event you know is important to them. It‚Äôs sharing in their suffering or happiness. It‚Äôs having your friend invest time and energy in you in a similar way. In short, it‚Äôs the give and take of a healthy relationship. There are times when we‚Äôre in the giving position in a relationship and when we‚Äôre on the receiving end. <br></p> 
   <p>But take a moment and reflect. Is there a dynamic with your friend where you‚Äôre always the one giving? If you are the only one investing time and energy, listening to your friend‚Äôs problems, worries and celebrations, then is your friendship a balanced one? If you are always on the receiving end of a friendship, then are you being a good friend? Both of these scenarios tilt our relationships. They make us or our friends feel isolated and alone. Do we really want to feel this way or make our friend feel this way? If not, then what can we do to change this?<br></p> 
   <h2><strong>How Can We Be Better Friends?</strong></h2> 
   <p>The fact is we can‚Äôt choose our families, but we can choose our friends. Sometimes we grow closer to our friends than we ever will to our families. Though forming such friendships isn‚Äôt just a matter of spending time with them. It‚Äôs supporting them when they‚Äôre going through difficult times or even sitting quietly by them, to let them know they‚Äôre not alone. It‚Äôs celebrating their accomplishments and sharing in their happiness. It‚Äôs having our friends be there for us in the same way. If we find it difficult to connect to others or our friends, then it might be time to reflect on the nature of our relationships. Sit down for a moment and meditate on them. How balanced is your friendship? When was the last time you were truly there for a friend or a friend was truly there for you? Do you, perhaps, take your friendship for granted? Gratitude meditations can be an excellent practice to figure this out. When was the last time you paused and thought to yourself how lucky you were to have a friend? &nbsp;When was the last time you let you friend know how you feel? <br></p> 
   <p>Compassion meditations can also help you figure out your relationship to your friends. How compassionate are you to others? How do you react when a friend comes up to you with a problem? Do you sweep it under the rug and get them to try and ignore it? Do you talk it out with your friend and try to get to the bottom of it? Do you listen and just try to be there for them? Do you understand what they really need in the moment and respond accordingly? If not, then meditating on how you can be more compassionate and understanding towards others can be an excellent way of learning to do better.<br></p> 
   <p>Whatever our hang ups with friendships may be, we can always do better. We only need to be open and willing to try harder. We need to learn to see how we are in relationships, without judging ourselves or our friends. Most importantly, we need to openly communicate with our friends about how we feel. Because only then can we work together to better our relationship. <br></p> 
   <p>Lastly, we‚Äôd love to hear from you on your relationships with your friends. What do you consider to be a good friend, how would you like to be a better friend? </p>

The Longing for Connection üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>

  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>Albert Camus once stated that, ‚Äúin order to understand the world, one has to turn away from it on occasion.‚Äù What one can understand from this is that solitude gives us the space we need to contemplate the world we experience. It‚Äôs a private time for us to go over our day, as well as our reactions to it. Our emotions, thoughts, worries, desires‚Ä¶ They all become clearer to us when we scrutinize them in the light of ourselves. Yet despite this, most of us equate solitude with loneliness and therefore misery. Recent studies claim that three out of four people suffer from ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù. Countries the world over have declared that there‚Äôs an epidemic of loneliness, though that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. In fact, what we suffer from might not be loneliness. It might just be our inability to understand and embrace solitude and therefore ourselves.</p>

   <h2><strong>Running Away From Ourselves to Escape Loneliness</strong></h2> 
   <p>Simply defined, loneliness is the longing for human connection. It‚Äôs being unable to form a true connection with others when we‚Äôre surrounded by others, and similarly being unable to connect with ourselves when we‚Äôre alone. This can leave us feeling lonely, for example, when we‚Äôre home or out alone, despite being with ourselves or even surrounded by others. We‚Äôve become so disconnected that we think we‚Äôre lonely when we don‚Äôt have anyone other than ourselves to talk to. Writer Hannah Arendt has said that one of the most positive connections we can form is with ourselves when we are alone: ‚ÄúThinking, existentially speaking is a solitary but not lonely business; solitude is that human situation in which I keep myself company‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>By conversing with ourselves, we can explore our inner worlds and understand who we are as people. A lot of us lead these lives where when we come back home from work or school, we feel as though we are diving into isolation. Throughout the day we run from one place to another, a never-ending list of chores in our hands. We barely have time to say ‚Äúhello‚Äù to the people around us, let alone have a proper conversation. At night we come home, maybe make some dinner, turn on the TV, go on Facebook or Twitter to chat with people, mistaking this for social interaction. We use these distractions as an escape from solitude. They allow us to escape our own thoughts and emotions. We run away from our own selves and what‚Äôs worse is that we don‚Äôt even realize it. Pretty soon we get so used to this that in our minds, being alone becomes synonymous with being lonely.</p> 
   <h2><strong>Superficial Forms of Human Connection</strong></h2> 
   <p>Alternatively, maybe we go out at night, grab dinner or have a drink with some friends. Though consider the substance of most of those conversations. Oftentimes, we can spend hours with people and never exchange anything but smalltalk and pleasantries. This isn‚Äôt a judgement‚Äîwe all do this pretty often. This is more a call to awareness that these light conversations can leave us feeling still disconnected and lonely. We rarely share what‚Äôs really going on in our minds and hearts. We don‚Äôt dive into the anxiety or pain we‚Äôre feeling, or the struggles and challenges we‚Äôre facing. If we do, we‚Äôre often met with a sympathetic smile and a ‚Äúthere, there‚Äù or ‚Äúhave a drink‚Äù.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>In our minds we interpret this as being social, when in reality we aren‚Äôt forming a real human connection. Just as we discuss loving ourselves before being able to truly love someone else, we must also first learn to feel comfortable with and embrace spending time with ourselves, before seeking out remedies for our loneliness through companionship or distractions.</p>

   <p>If we want to form genuine connections and if we want to be rid of our loneliness and restlessness, then we must first change our relationship and understanding of ‚Äúsolitude‚Äù. We must redefine what being alone means for us, along with our relationship with ourselves. Only then can we begin to form true connections with others.&nbsp;</p> 
   <h2><strong>Human Connection as an Innate Need and Survival Mechanism</strong></h2> 
   <p>We all experience difficult emotions sometimes: Anger, fear, loneliness‚Ä¶ These emotions are remnants of the survival mechanisms that kept us alive during the stone age. We feel fear because it allows us to run from danger. We feel anger because it propels us to fight an enemy. Loneliness&nbsp; works almost the same way.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>Consider this: why are we able to feel lonely? Why do we have the need to connect with others? Humans survived for hundreds of years by banding together. To quote Game of Thrones: ‚ÄúWhen winter comes, the lone wolf dies but the pack survives.‚Äù To survive winter and other difficult situations, we need others. We need a tribe, family, friends‚Ä¶ In the past human beings used to live in tribes of 150-200 people. Everyone in the tribe knew and supported each other, because they needed and depended on one another. They had actual conversations because ephemeral ones would never serve them. They shared information, experiences, thoughts, feelings‚Ä¶ They imparted what they learned to the generations that came after them‚Ä¶ Driven by their needs, they formed actual communities and relationships. So what happened between then and now?&nbsp;</p> 
   <p>We still have an innate need to connect. When we lack that connection with others, we begin to feel lonely. But imagine if we couldn‚Äôt feel lonely. Imagine that ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù did not exist. If that were the case, would you ever feel the need or desire to go out of your house and hang out with people? Would you ever seek friendships or relationships? Of course not. So, in a weird way loneliness prompts us to get up, walk away from the TV and seek human connection. Our ability to feel lonely is to a degree responsible for our families, love lives and friendships. That is, as long as we are able to properly define loneliness and our relationship to it.</p>

   <p>If we‚Äôre lucky ‚Äì and most of us are luckier than we think ‚Äì we‚Äôll form bonds with people who will appreciate the trust and confidence we have in them. Not only that, but they‚Äôll reciprocate it. That is to say, they will trust us with parts of themselves as well. They will acknowledge the risk we‚Äôre taking in trusting them little by little and also begin to approach us with more about themselves. Over time, if that mutual trust is respected and preserved, it will grow over time and develop into a dependable and strong connection. This connection gives us as humans a great deal of comfort, support and resilience. In a sense it translates as, ‚ÄúI see who you are. This is who I am. And I am here for you‚Äù.</p> 
   <p>Loneliness isn‚Äôt an incurable disease. Yet it does take an active effort to consider why we feel lonely and how we can take steps to ease that loneliness. This requires us to lean into feeling more comfortable with ourselves and more comfortable with the idea of trusting others. Yet, no amount of time with other people will ever quench feelings of loneliness if we at first cannot enjoy our own presence and essence.&nbsp;</p>

   <p>Edited by: Christine Taylor</p> 
   <p>I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. It took me two years to get out. By the time I did, I was a shell of who I used to be. I had cut off all contact with my family and friends. I was convinced I was the ugliest and most useless person on the planet. I thought I was so useless that I couldn‚Äôt even boil pasta right.</p> 
   <h3><strong>Why didn‚Äôt I leave? </strong></h3> 
   <p>One of the most common questions I get when I share my experience with others is ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just leave‚Äù? Well, as you can guess, it‚Äôs not that simple, mostly because as the victim, you most likely don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs abusive until it‚Äôs too far gone. An emotionally abusive relationship isn‚Äôt something where there‚Äôs just a barrage of insults, all at once. If it was, I and other victims like me would probably be prompted to not even continue the relationship. In an emotionally abusive relationship, it first starts off well, and then over time, little by little, the subtle insults, manipulative remarks, and passive aggressive comments begin to increase more and more. &nbsp;Essentially, your ‚Äúpartner‚Äù chips away at you ‚Äì your self-confidence, your sense of self ‚Äì bit by bit, without you even realizing it. They will use insults and criticisms disguised as compliments.They will be be careful in choosing the words they use to criticize you. </p> 
   <p>The word my partner used for me was ‚Äúditzy‚Äù. It sounds like a cute, non-threatening word. But when it‚Äôs hammered into you it begins to chip away. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so ditzy, you burned the pasta.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so ditzy, you don‚Äôt even know where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù On and on, for days and months on end, until you become convinced that that‚Äôs who you are. Ditzy. Careless. Silly. Unable to even do the simplest of things.</p> 
   <h3><strong>Why didn‚Äôt I fight back?</strong></h3> 
   <p>Another thing I‚Äôm asked; ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you object?‚Äù Well, sometimes I did. But it becomes hard to stand up for yourself when your objections are met with ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre overreacting‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being over-sensitive‚Äù or even ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only telling you this because I love you‚Äù. It‚Äôs responses like this that make you think ‚ÄúMaybe I am overreacting. He‚Äôs only trying to help‚Äù. And thus, you begin to find blame in yourself. It‚Äôs always your fault, never his.</p> 
   <h3><strong>Truly believing that it‚Äôs not your fault.</strong></h3> 
   <p>But here‚Äôs the thing: It‚Äôs not your fault. It never was. I wish someone had told me this at the time. In all fairness though, they couldn‚Äôt have. I was so programmed to think that everything that went wrong was my fault, that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to hear what was being said. And even if I was, who on earth would have been able to tell me this once I‚Äôd cut off all contact with friends and family?</p> 
   <p>That‚Äôs another thing about emotionally abusive relationships: they revolve around control. Your ‚Äúpartner‚Äù has to control every aspect of your life. Where you go, what you do, what you eat, who you see‚Ä¶ In my case, I saw no one. He convinced me that one friend was only spending time with me because she was broke. Another supposedly didn‚Äôt care enough about me to make time for me. My ‚Äúpartner‚Äù was the only person that cared about me. He was the only person I could rely on. Or so he had me believe.</p> 
   <p>When you‚Äôre cut off from the rest of the world like this and when you‚Äôve been reprogrammed to think that every little thing is your fault, you inevitably become more attached to your abuser. The more he mistreats you, the more you crave his warmth and affection. And he does give that. After all, he has to balance out the mistreatment with something. He has to throw you some bait, so you‚Äôll bite and start to think that he really does love you, that things will get better from now on. Trust me, they never will.</p> 
   <h3><strong>3 Ways to Break Out of an Abusive Relationship</strong></h3> 
   <p>So, the question remains‚Äîhow does one break out of an abusive relationship? How does one start to reclaim one‚Äôs self? Well, there is a certain point when the human psyche cannot take the abuse anymore, even if it doesn‚Äôt realize that it‚Äôs abuse. In my case, this breaking point came with a constant state of anxiety and panic attacks. Things got so bad that I couldn‚Äôt sleep at night. Things got so bad that I had to admit that <em>something</em> was wrong, and that I needed help. </p> 
   <p>Help came in three ways; the first was my parents and sister who, despite all my efforts to cut them out of my life refused to give up. At first, they only sat with me and listened. They didn‚Äôt jump on every opportunity to point out my partner‚Äôs wrongdoings. They let me vent. They also recommended that I start seeing a therapist. That was my second source of help. Speaking with a professional about my life and what I‚Äôd been going through with my partner helped me see what was happening with more clarity and objectivity. This clarity and reason offered by my therapist helped me to see that I couldn‚Äôt be as incompetent as I‚Äôd been made to believe I was. The more I talked with my family and my therapist, the more the ingrained belief that I was to blame began to dissolve. But I still wasn‚Äôt ready to leave.</p> 
   <p>The third resource that helped get to my ‚Äúbreaking point‚Äù was meditation. I‚Äôd never been a practitioner of meditation nor did I really believe in it. Yet my anxiety had gotten so bad and my mind so confused that I was willing to try anything. </p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">  
    <noscript>  
    </noscript> 
   </figure> 
   <p>At first, it was difficult for me sit through my anxiety and concentrate on my breathing. It was even more difficult to learn to let the self-derogatory thoughts I‚Äôd been trained to think drift by. Thanks to my persistence and the support system I found in my family and therapist, I began to realize that these were just thoughts, not facts that defined me. Nor were they even my thoughts. </p> 
   <p>The more time that passed, the more I realized to what extent I‚Äôd let someone else define who I was. It was terrifying to realize how much of myself I‚Äôd let go of, willingly. It was at this point that I was finally able to not only hear and accept the words ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault‚Äù but say them out-loud and believe them.</p> 
   <p>I was lucky enough to get out of an abusive relationship, but I recognize that not everyone currently in the midst of this toxic dynamic has the self-belief and tools to break out of it. I hope that by sharing my story those who are in an abusive relationships are able to pull on the resources around them for support, including their loved ones, professional help and meditations. Equally important, my hope is that we as a society also accept that anyone can end up in an abusive relationship. It‚Äôs often viewed as a situation only weak or submissive individuals get into, but since ending this relationship I have met many victims who were strong, resilient, self-confident, and independent, yet also fell victim to another‚Äôs manipulation. It‚Äôs important that rather than feeling sympathy, pity or embarrassment for victims, that we instead reach out with compassion and a non-judgemental approach. It‚Äôs important to understand that when a loved one is in such a relationship, we should endeavor to be there for them without judgement. It‚Äôs important to support them and wait for the moment when they‚Äôll be ready to finally hear: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault‚Äù.<br></p>

We Suck at Comforting People: How Do We Do Better? üåø Meditopia Blog,"<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <div id=""bsf_rt_marker""> 
   <p>When someone we love is upset, having a meltdown or in an immense amount of pain, our go-to reaction is generally to try our best to cheer them up or say something along the lines of ‚Äòeverything will be okay‚Äô. Perhaps you‚Äôve been in this exact situation recently. Someone you loved was struggling with something and you just wanted them to feel better, so you did your best to offer solutions or point out the positive aspects of the situation. So you jumped right in to point out what solutions there might be to the problem, or maybe you went and ordered their favorite food, or invited them to go out and forget their worries. Perhaps you said something along the lines of ‚ÄúThis will work itself out, don‚Äôt worry, everything will be fine.‚Äù </p> 
   <p>Though take a moment to now think of a time when you were in the same distressed position. How much did it help you to be told not to worry or that everything was going to be okay? Did it feel better the next day after you and your friend had gone through a whole pizza, carton of ice cream and bottle of wine? Probably not. I know because I‚Äôve been there many times. It‚Äôs taken me a long time to realize that these temporary actions we take to numb our pain, worries and anxiety aren‚Äôt actually helpful, for ourselves and for others. This revelation came to me while doing mindfulness meditations, and since then I‚Äôve tried to take a different approach in how I comfort my loved ones and how I comfort myself. </p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">  
    <noscript>  
    </noscript> 
   </figure> 
   <h3><strong>How to Comfort Someone‚Ä¶the right and wrong way.</strong></h3> 
   <h3><strong>Practicing compassion is easier said than done. </strong></h3> 
   <p>Admittedly, I‚Äôm not the most empathetic person in the world. I‚Äôve realized that it‚Äôs actually pretty difficult for me to sometimes take a step outside of my own little world long enough to relate to other people‚Äôs problems. That doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt care about others. What it means is that it‚Äôs challenging for me to understand what someone needs when they‚Äôre going through something difficult. I think we all sometimes struggle trying to decipher the best way to comfort others. So much of the time we‚Äôre only considering our needs and feelings that when we see someone else in need of comfort, we freeze, not sure of the right move. It requires us to pause and commit to empathizing with another person, temporarily suspending our own agendas, needs, and emotions; easier said than done. </p> 
   <p>I first realized this weakness of mine a couple of years ago, when my husband and I decided to get a divorce. I still loved him, and I suddenly found myself all alone with an 8-year-old and a string of depressive thoughts swirling around my head. During this time, many friends came to visit me, all of them telling me that everything would be okay. The more people told me this, the angrier I felt. Hearing this wasn‚Äôt helpful. It felt as though my current experience was being dismissed and rushed. I knew that everything would be OK, but that knowledge did not stop me from feeling horrible in the moment. Nor did that fact help me feel better sooner. See, when we‚Äôre in pain, we need time and we need our emotions and condition at the time to be acknowledged, not dismissed. </p> 
   <figure class=""wp-block-image"">  
    <noscript>  
    </noscript> 
   </figure> 
   <p>At the time, I just couldn‚Äôt stop the negative feelings and thoughts I was experiencing. On top of that, what my friends were saying made me feel like the heartbreak and panic I felt, the grief I harbored for my failed marriage was invalid. I quickly realized that what I needed wasn‚Äôt someone rubbing my back, saying ‚Äúthere, there‚Äù in a soothing voice. What I needed was a companion. I needed someone to stand by my side, silently and without judgement, sharing the moment with me, as well as my sorrow and my emotions. I needed someone who mindfully listened, embraced me with all his/her heart and mind.</p> 
   <h3><strong>What Is Compassion and Why We Actually Need It</strong></h3> 
   <p>Psychologists define compassion as the ability to understand the emotional state of a person other than ourselves. This definition, though, should not be confused with empathy. When we empathize with someone, we‚Äôre able to put ourselves in their shoes. When we show compassion to someone however, we are able to understand how they feel and give them what they need. It sounds simple enough, but in fact it‚Äôs difficult to do in our ego-centric worlds. Like all difficult things, though, it‚Äôs a practice that comes with immense rewards. For instance, according to a study by the researchers James Fellow Ed Diener and James McKeen Cattell Fellow, ‚Äúindividuals that connect with others through compassion actually enjoy better mental and physical health‚Äù.</p> 
   <p>There are several reasons for this. First, according to a study conducted at the National Institute of Technology being compassionate towards others stimulates the pleasure areas of the brain. Stimulating the pleasure areas of the brain acts as a counter to stress. This is why we eat junk food or go on a shopping spree when we‚Äôre stressed. By being compassionate towards others, we stimulate these areas in a healthy way, thereby reducing stress which is very damaging to our immune systems.</p> 
   <p>Second, past research has proven that depression and anxiety are linked to a state of self-focus. Compassion, however, requires us to focus on others, instead of ourselves. Shifting our perspective to the well-being and experiences of others can help ease our egocentric thoughts and thereby prevent thoughts of depression and anxiety. Shifting our focus also gives us a sense of purpose that further stimulates the pleasure centers of the brain.</p> 
   <p>Third, showing compassion to others strengthens our connection with others. Having strong, supportive connections with others strengthens our immune systems, increases our self-esteem and sense of trust. Additionally, an increased sense of trust prompts others to trust us more and thus become closer to us. This creates a positive feedback loop that is overall very good for both our mental and physical wellbeing. </p>

   <h3><strong>How we can be more compassionate and supportive of our loved ones? </strong></h3> 
   <p>While compassion is an instinct that exists in everyone, it‚Äôs one that needs to be practiced constantly. There are several ways this can be done:</p> 
   <h4><strong>Be Present</strong></h4> 
   <p>How can we be more compassionate towards someone if we are not in the moment with them? In order to support people we love, we have to learn to be with them, in the moment. Meditation primarily teaches us to be aware of the moment we are in. We can therefore use it to learn how we can be present for the people we care about.</p> 
   <h4><strong>Listen Mindfully</strong></h4> 
   <p>Feeling like someone we love isn‚Äôt truly listening to us is an awful feeling, especially if they are bearing their feelings to us. Paying real attention to what others are saying, showing interest and support, encouraging them to express their thoughts and feelings are what mindful listening is about. Whenever your mind wanders or starts thinking about the response you‚Äôll give, take a breath in and come back to the moment.</p> 
   <h4><strong>Connect with your heart</strong></h4> 
   <p>When we‚Äôre with someone, we should truly feel and understand what they‚Äôre going through. In other words, we should be empathetic and compassionate with them. One way of doing this is through meditation. It‚Äôs been scientifically proven that ‚Äúloving-kindness‚Äù meditations or compassion meditations help to cultivate our instinct for compassion. </p> 
   <h4><strong>Eliminate Judgement</strong></h4> 
   <p>It‚Äôs important to remember that we shouldn‚Äôt judge the person in front of us, no matter what they are feeling. Judgement is the opposite of support. So, we must remember to be a safe zone for them, where they can talk about their experience, without shame. </p> 
   <h4><strong>Try to understand all aspects of someone‚Äôs situation</strong></h4> 
   <p>Another thing to bear in mind is to try and see past our own perspective. We should instead strive to see the situation from the perspective of our loved one. Most likely this isn‚Äôt a stranger in front of you. You‚Äôve spent a considerable amount of time and can use your observations and knowledge about them to imagine how they‚Äôre approaching this situation. Again it‚Äôs not our place to say whether their approach is right or wrong; compassion and support require us to merely be with them in the moment, however they‚Äôre feeling. </p> 
   <h4><strong>Mean what you say, and say what you mean</strong></h4> 
   <p>Lastly, we should choose our words carefully. We shouldn‚Äôt turn to meaningless clich√©s like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright‚Äù or ‚Äúeverything will turn out okay‚Äù. Instead, we should gauge what the person before us needs, or even ask them what they need from us. Sometimes, no words are necessary, just a silent listener and presence. </p> 
   <p>If psychology tells us anything, it‚Äôs that understanding others and showing them compassion isn‚Äôt something that happens overnight. People need time and a willingness to learn, in order to be able to get to that point. They also need the right tools which guide them in their journey to practice these skills. </p> 
   <p>So, next time you want to comfort a friend, try to consider what you‚Äôve just read and do your best to listening intently, being present, focusing on their needs and experience, and connecting with your heart. Put your judgements aside and be there, right in that moment, with your loved one. <br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Before going into , let‚Äôs first recap what stress is and what it does to the body. Stress is a survival mechanism from our caveman days. When we see a perceived threat or, these days, an unmet need or task to complete we feel stress and go into ‚Äúfight or fly mode‚Äù. As a result, the hormones cortisol and adrenaline are released into our bodies, causing our hearts to beat faster, our blood pressure and blood sugar to rise, our immune system to be suppressed, our breathing to quicken and less blood supply to be delivered to our digestive tract. If stress is only temporary, then these things don‚Äôt pose a problem; in fact, they can boost our performance, focus and capabilities, helping us conquer whatever it is that‚Äôs causing us stress.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">The problem is , ongoing state of the body and mind. This continuous release of cortisol and adrenaline can then, in turn, lead to serious health issues including high blood pressure, heart disease, migraines or diabetes, to name a few.</p>

   <h2 id=""h-how-does-meditation-alleviate-stress""><strong>How Does Meditation Alleviate Stress?</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When we pause and take the time to meditate, we are making an active decision to make a shift from a noisy, over-stimulated, and over-charged state of mind to a calmer, quieter one. In order to do so,  We pay attention to what thoughts are emerging in our minds without getting caught up in them. Instead, we let them drift by, detaching the hooks that used to latch onto our mind for days. We notice the feeling of our feet on the ground, the temperature of the air, the smell of the room.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">In focusing on the moment in this way, we send signals to our brain that say ‚ÄúWe are safe. We are ready to be calm.‚Äù After receiving these signals, our brains gradually begin to calm itself, thereby sending signals to the rest of our body to release and relax. Our heart rate goes down, our breathing slows and becomes deeper. As a result, the different side effects of stress dissipate, and our bodies resume their normal functions in a calm state of being, .</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Meditation is like going to the gym. The first time you go, you may only be able to run for a few minutes at a time on the treadmill. However, . In time, you‚Äôll be able to run for longer periods of time and not feel like keeling over after. Meditation works the same way. The more regularly you practice it, the better you‚Äôll get at maintaining positive emotions and thoughts, especially when bad things suddenly happen.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We might not always realize it, but most of us lead pretty hectic lives. Call it a blessing or curse, most of us are pretty good at pushing ourselves well beyond our abilities, constantly putting our needs and wants aside to meet. We continue putting ourselves second and then end up hitting a wall, depleted of all emotions,  and motivation. What‚Äôs worse is that our culture rewards and encourages this behavior (i.e. sleep when you‚Äôre dead, FOMO, exhaustion and business as a status symbol). Though constantly pushing ourselves to this point wreaks havoc on our emotional and physical state.</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Meditating on a consistent basis is a way to pump the brakes, force yourself to pause and tap back into that internal set of values that guide your day to day decisions. Meditation in itself is an act of self-care and promotes further consideration of your needs, . Instead of feeling like our schedule and time is out of our control, being sucked up by commitments, obligations and work, meditation acts as a tool that helps us regain a sense of that control. This, overtime, helps to stabilize our mood and general state of mind every day.</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-meditation-a-learning-process-not-a-pain-killer""><strong>Meditation: A learning process, not a pain killer</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">One thing we need to constantly remind ourselves is that meditation is not like a painkiller which will solve all of our woes and pain in an instant. We must be patient and consistent. Meditation is the practice of viewing different aspects of life from different perspectives. The more we practice, the more we‚Äôre able to carry that calm and objective vantage point with us well beyond the end of our meditations. At any moment, regardless of what , we‚Äôre able to view the emotions and physical sensations with wisdom and serenity. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs essential that we practice consistently in order to maintain this skill.&nbsp;</p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">As you go deeper into your practice, you will always learn something new. You will build yourself up anew, step by step. Only through continuous practice can these learnings and revelations become further ingrained in your way of thinking and living.&nbsp;</p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">When it comes to  there is no right or wrong. Meditation is a very deep, personal journey. No one person is the same and each of us is on a different journey, so there is no ‚Äúright‚Äù time to meditate. There‚Äôs only what‚Äôs right for <em>you</em>. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">That being said, most of us lead busy lives and without planning ahead, it may be difficult at times to figure out where we‚Äôre supposed to fit in . So, here are few suggestions that can help us to discover what might be ‚Äúright time‚Äù for each of us.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size""> can set the tone for the rest of the day. We‚Äôve all had those hectic, rushed and stressful mornings where we feel exhausted, and completely over the day before it‚Äôs even really started‚Äîthe days when our mornings start off like this hardly ever inspire greatness in us. Now, to those of you who covet those extra 15 minutes the snooze button gives you‚Äîbare with me. Giving yourself an extra 15 minutes to meditate before you start your day can help you recenter,, and manage all of the ups and downs the day will bring with more perspective and patience. It may seem difficult at first to wake up a little bit earlier, but you may find that these 15 minutes become as crucial to your morning routine as your coffee or tea. Remember though, that meditation in the morning may not be for everyone and meditation requires us to be alert and fully awake. So for some of us non-morning people (me pointing to myself), we may find that we can‚Äôt stay fully alert and awake while meditating in the morning. If this is the case, you may want to consider another time during the day. Let‚Äôs have a look at the other most common options. &nbsp;</p>

Many times throughout our meditations, as we end the practice we note that these practices can help you especially when you‚Äôre confronted with . The beauty of meditation is that with practice, we‚Äôre able to learn the skills to reconnect with the present moment, view our emotions and thoughts with renewed perspective, and calm our nervous system. So during the day, whenever you‚Äôre sensing your body and thoughts spiraling into a stress-trap, you can take a break and through meditation, hit the figurative reset button. &nbsp;Whether it‚Äôs rushing to meet a work deadline, stressing out about what to do in our relationship, worrying about a test we recently took‚Ä¶ Whatever the scenario, taking the time to reorient ourselves in such moments can be incredibly beneficial to our frame of mind and the health of our bodies. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Since this is the most common pause in our day, and if trying to meditate in the morning just leaves you feeling sleepy and drowsy, lunchtime may be a great opportunity to fit in some meditation. All you need is 15-20 minutes at the beginning or end of your lunch hour, and you‚Äôll be giving yourself a &nbsp;well-deserved break that resets your mind, calms your nervous system and lets you continue your day with a sense of calm and poise. What‚Äôs more, this could be , creativity and productivity, particularly if we have to get back to work or class once lunchtime is over.</p>

It can give us the space we need to process the days events, our emotions and reactions. It can help us observe and better understand our behaviors, actions and feelings throughout the day on a much more intimate level. Though if we‚Äôre going to meditate before we go to bed, it‚Äôs important to put at least an hour between our meditation and bedtime. This way you can avoid falling asleep or getting drowsy during your meditation.<br></p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It may take a bit of experimentation during the first few weeks, trying to meditate at different times of the day, though the important point is that you find a 15+ minute time slot when you‚Äôre alert and awake. You can try each of these time periods, each for a few days in a row and then best decide which time seems to feel the best for you. While some people alternate and meditate at different times of the day depending on their schedules, we‚Äôve found that picking one consistent time everyday encourages you to follow through with beginning your practice. Like all things, routine facilitates consistency and persistence. <br></p>

   <h3 id=""h-being-present-in-the-moment""><strong>Being Present in the Moment</strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Sounds simple right? Well, I actually find this part the most difficult to practice in my life. Whenever I observe myself going through my day to day activities, I find that there‚Äôs always something else that‚Äôs going on in the back of my mind. Right now, for example, my colleagues are seeing me typing on my computer, but in the back of my mind, I‚Äôm thinking about my husband who has a bad cold and who‚Äôs feeling miserable at home. I‚Äôm wondering how he‚Äôs doing and if I can pick up some groceries to make a healthy soup for us when I get home. Our minds always seem to have different tracks playing at the same time, and in this culture of productivity and multitasking, we‚Äôre encouraged to keep those tracks going all at once. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">It‚Äôs the same case when I‚Äôm going through the motions, in the middle of activities that are so routine that I don‚Äôt need to pay attention to what I‚Äôm doing. Think about it; how often have you found yourself parked in front of your house without remembering the drive home, or finishing a meal without really taking the time to . What about those times when you have to continuously re-read a passage in a book because mid-paragraph your mind wanders and you realize you‚Äôve ‚Äúfinished‚Äù the page without a clue what you read. These are all indicators of an . And when the mind flies away and continues to hop from the future to the past and back, we lose connection with our bodies. Thus unfolds the 2<sup>nd</sup> part of the definition of Mindfulness.</p>

   <h3 id=""h-body-awareness-noticing-the-present-sensations-and-feelings-in-your-body""><strong>Body Awareness</strong>: <strong>Noticing the present sensations and feelings in your body. </strong></h3> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">We tend to assume that our mind is independent of our body. Though, have you ever considered that your emotions and thoughts can have a direct impact on your physical health and well-being? Have you considered that our anxieties, worries, sadness, and fears can actually make us ill? When our attention drifts away from the present moment and focuses solely on our worries or anxieties, we begin to disregard our current feelings and sensations. As we detach from how our bodies currently feel in this exact moment, our bodies react by creating tension, a tension we aren‚Äôt even conscious of. Participating in  are one of the easy ways to bring your attention to the present moment and to how your body is feeling.</p> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div>

   </div> 
   <div style=""height:30px"" aria-hidden=""true"" class=""wp-block-spacer""></div> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here‚Äôs a personal example of what this looks like. When something upsetting happens between me and my husband or a friend of mine, I shut down; it‚Äôs like my throat clamps up, my mind shuts down and I go silent. These are moments when the introvert in me comes rearing its head and takes control over my entire body and mind. Now, in the moment, since I‚Äôm unable to express my current feelings, I feel inclined to veil them by keeping myself busy with something else. I essentially inhibit myself with my own feelings, like putting a handkerchief of feelings down my throat to keep my quiet. When I finally start to express myself, I immediately feel the tension in my chest, shoulders, back, and stomach begin to release and relax. My jaw softens, and my neck loosens up. </p> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">I know you can relate; I know there are situations that seize control over your body, maybe without you even realizing. What these situations tell us is that our emotions and feelings have a direct and powerful influence on the state of our bodies. By remaining present with the sensations we‚Äôre experiencing throughout our bodies, we‚Äôre able to more readily reassert control over how we feel through compassionate and patience observation. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Now that we better understand the meaning of mindfulness, the next question becomes if we can even begin to master it. As we practice mindfulness on a more consistent basis, we‚Äôll begin to use it as a tool of recalibrating our thoughts, feelings and physical status. We‚Äôll become more aware of how our thoughts flitter from the future to the past, and be able to more actively draw our attention back to the present moment. The best way to sharpen this tool is simply to practice. &nbsp;Be patient with yourself, this isn‚Äôt about rushing through an exercise or even seeing immediate results; this will take time and perseverance, but I assure you it‚Äôs something absolutely within your grasp. </p>

   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Here‚Äôs why: </p> 
   <ul class=""has-medium-font-size""> 
    <li>Mindfulness is a basic skill that we all have naturally. We all have the ability to be aware of the present moment and our present feelings and sensations from birth.</li> 
    <li>The ability to be mindful takes more than one approach. Mindfulness can be cultivated with several tried and true methods. Meditation is one of those methods and it doesn‚Äôt matter how you do it. Whether you‚Äôre sitting, walking, or moving in any way, by simply shifting your attention to what you‚Äôre doing right in that moment, you can quickly connect with the present moment. </li> 
    <li>Mindfulness doesn‚Äôt require you to change who you are. Rather, it allows you to get to know yourself better. A better version of yourself is revealed with mindfulness practice. </li> 
    <li>Anyone can do mindfulness exercises. Don‚Äôt be intimidated by all of the big words and freakishly serene-looking yogis you see in meditation blogs and posts. Mindfulness is something everyone, regardless of their familiarity with meditation, is able to do. </li> 
    <li>Mindfulness will have a positive impact on your life. Having more awareness and more compassion will begin to accompany everything you do and impact everyone around you. It will eliminate unnecessary stress and anxiety and all of your reactions to the stressors and problems you experience will be calmer, softer, more conscious and effective.</li>

There are many tools that those individuals who want to improve themselves and their senses can use. One such tool is books. Books have long been a means of developing our minds and increasing our awareness. So why not gloss over those must-read books that will nurture us on multiple levels:</p> 
   <h2 id=""h-the-alchemist-paulo-coelho""><strong>The Alchemist ‚Äì Paulo Coelho</strong></h2> 
   <p class=""has-medium-font-size"">Paulo Coelho has long been considered a modern classic. This short novella tells the story of Andalusian shepherd Santiago, who sets out on a vast journey across the world in search of treasure.
